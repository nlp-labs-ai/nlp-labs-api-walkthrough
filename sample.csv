279977484,3,2015-6,United Kingdom,"As a family we left a little disappointed by our visit to DLP. The atmosphere in the park is brought down by rude people who think nothing of pushing in front of others in queues and smoking wherever they want. There also seemed to be a lot of construction work going on around the park and a few of the rides were shut. I have visited Disney World in Florida several times and have never encountered any of these problems there.On a positive note some of the rides were very good such as Thunder mountain, small world and Pirates of the Carribean. If you have younger children DLP is also more manageable to get round as its a much smaller park than Florida. Overall we managed to enjoy our holiday but think we will save for Florida next time.",Disneyland_Paris
182524324,5,2013-6,United States,"It truly IS the funnest place on earth!!! We had the chance to take our daughter and kids to Disneyland and it was their very first time to go! What fun they had...and ALL the way home, that was ALL they could talk about!!!! It is so nice to be able to see Disneyland thru the eyes of a child again!!!! We ALL had a great time!!!",Disneyland_California
603684918,4,2017-12,United States,"We took the bus from Shenzhen to get there (give yourself time   the trip can take a while). We were there in December, so the crowds weren't too bad. Best rides to go on: Hyperspace Mountain (like Space Mountain in the US, but Star Wars themed), Mystic Manor (the Hong Kong answer to the Haunted Mansion), and Big Grizzly Mountain   truly the best surprise of the three! One pet peeve: as a US citizen there, I was sad that all the popcorn was sweet rather than salty. I would've loved some butter and salt popcorn while I was there.",Disneyland_HongKong
278627765,5,2014-10,United States,I always love Disneyland. Best Rides and atmosphere ever! We could easily spend several days here alone!,Disneyland_California
193829431,3,2014-2,Panama,"It was nice to be at the original park created by Walt Disney, they have great rides like Indiana Jones.But it was disgusting that they have 4 main atractions closed at the same time like Splash Mountain, Big Thunder RR coaster, Finding Nemo and It's a Small World.So waiting time in attractions like Space Mountain and Indiana Jones were too much compared with the waiting times in California adventures.But it is a Disney park and is always magical to be around.",Disneyland_California
419622519,1,2016-9,United States,Nightmare at Disneyland we have been asked to leave five rides because they broke down we are standing at the speedway now number five Break down somebody needs to do preventative maintenance we have visited Tokyo Disney and Walt Disney World in Florida it has never happened there for us they keep on saying safety but I think you equipment is old and not taking care of very well,Disneyland_California
219891503,5,2014-7,Malaysia,"The theme park is well maintain and the whole environment is clean as usual. Though the china visitor is really rude and not queue properly, using flash to take picture during the show, making big noise everywhere, but the staff is giving a big patient to control them and try not to affect others.",Disneyland_HongKong
641999778,5,2018-12,Kenya,"We visited just after Christmas 27th but the long line never ended . Was great to catch Mickey and Minnie at the first stop.We booked the tour with gray line tours in hongkong , Candy and Gladys were the best . You can get there by subway ( mtr). ",Disneyland_HongKong
165035144,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"i really enjoyed my first trip to disneyland paris so much that i went back a further 4 times so far :)the toilets are young children friendly with sinks that are nice and low for young kids etc. plenty of attractions for all ages, and the staff are very friendly. Plenty of eateries and souvenir shops. you will want for nothing but more money to spend haha. kids will love it.",Disneyland_Paris
319954384,4,2015-10,United States,"We live Disneyland and have been waiting six years to go back. I thought I had planned our trip at a slower time, but it was REALLY crowded. Four day park hopper, and the lines were so crazy we barely got to ride what we wanted once, even with Fastpass. It was so crowded we couldn't even find a place to view e fireworks or parade, despite being on Main Street two hours early. By all means, go! But, if you have a choice, wait until the 60th anniversary madness is over.",Disneyland_California
240092631,5,2014-11,United States,"Definitely the happiest place on earth! If you want to spend the whole day in the park, make sure to bring a jacket pants. If you don't want to carry it around they have lockers available for $7 a day. Can't wait until my next visit.",Disneyland_California
407858814,5,2016-8,United Kingdom,Popped over for a day at Disneyland Paris and it never fails to make me happy. Even though it was school holidays the queues weren't excessive and we managed to have a really good day. A two park ticket for 6 people for the day isn't the cheapest but it is worth every penny. My kids absolutely loved it and so did my wife and I. There is something for everyone and if you need a proper thrill it's got that too. Everyone should visit here at least once in their life. Brilliant. ,Disneyland_Paris
163189531,5,2013-6,United States,"Everything is great about Disneyland, but just one thing .... my family is NOT a fan of Grad nights and we try to book our yearly family vacation around these dates at all costs. Grad Nights are usually in May and June and are pretty much every Wed, Thurs, Fri and Sat. The parks get crowded with graduating high schoolers. I'm sure most are good, but it's the loud, obnoxious, clueless, self centered, pushy, unmannered teens that make a family with younger children not be able to enjoy the parks. Google and do your research on when these DL Grad Nite dates are. Personally, I'm looking forward to the day Disney pulls the plug on all grad nights. For Fantasmic viewing I recommend trying to sit in the RiverBelle restaurant patio area. You will need to get there early to claim your table!",Disneyland_California
395377275,2,2016-6,South Africa,We were so excited about this day trip that we planned. It is very expensive and my older kids (23 and 21) found that there is not enough rides for young adults. In comparison to the one in Singapore this was not worth the time or money. The cooldrinks and water was over prized. Will not recommend Hong Kong Disneyland,Disneyland_HongKong

169619838,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We travelled as a three generation family and had lovely weather, which was a bonus. However, the inability of park staff to enforce their own smoking ban is a severe drawback. Having to walk through groups standing smoking on pathways and in entrances to toilet facilities is not pleasant. In their defence, we did not see any of the areas that were supposed to be the specially designated areas for smokers. The solution seems to be simple, anyone smoking in an inappropriate place should be ejected from the park and their ticket cancelled. It would not take too long for the message to get through. In general though, the queues were well controlled with good communication, but nevertheless this park did not have the feel of a  Magical Kingdom  that Disney claims for it.",Disneyland_Paris
207195525,5,missing,United States,I love disneyland I have been their probably 25 times and I have counted. I love both parks and nothing is ever bad there... Go very soon... It was so much fun.    ,Disneyland_California
620279782,4,2018-9,United Kingdom,We had s lovely time as you would expect. But a few rides were closed and several times rides were delayed or broke down.  More engineers needed!  Fireworks display is not too be missed,Disneyland_Paris
118468396,5,2011-9,South Korea,"We had a great time here. My 6 year old daughter really liked most of the rides. She loved Crush's coaster and Thunder Mountain. The Tower of Terror really scared her though, and she was crying for a little while after. She loved meeting the characters and had a lot of time to spend with them at Inventions buffet in the DL hotel and also at the Cowboy Cookout in Frontierland DLP.",Disneyland_Paris
209225612,5,2014-5,Singapore,"As this is the happiness places on earth no doubt you will see Mickey, Donald and the rest of the folks. Go through the show timing so that you can plan your walk path. Stay back till 9.00pm to watch the wonderful fireworks but please...More",Disneyland_HongKong

247064371,4,2014-12,United States,"A compact version of its big US relative, all the good stuff there but the queues and crazy fast pass system lets it down (good in theory but not in practice). Poor food quality and inflated prices don't help the overall experience but hey it's Disney so it's hard not to love!",Disneyland_Paris
285927429,3,2014-11,Canada,We went there in November where the Christmas decorations were up already! It is small compared to Disney California and Disneyworld but equally beautiful! We're lucky that we didn't get rain. The small world ride is fantastic! Don't miss this!,Disneyland_Paris
366622443,4,2016-4,Denmark,"I visited this park with my family on a weekday. I have been to Disney parks in the US and this one is smaller than those but it's a good one especially if you have young kids with you. It wasn't very crowded for the rides perhaps because it was a weekend and except Autopia and Dumbo the Elephant, we didn't have to wait too long for the rides. My recommended rides if you have kids with you: Mickey's 4d show, Dumbo the Elephant, Autopia, Jungle river cruise, Mickey and the Wondrous Book. Also, the parades (one around 3pm and another around 7:30pm) and the fireworks at closing are nice. Suggest going early when it isn't crowded.",Disneyland_HongKong
386792515,4,2016-6,United States,"Sadly when we were visiting two of our favorite rides(space mountain and railroad coaster in Frontier land) were closed for maintenance construction. The lines at this place were very short! I don't think we waited more than 10 min for any rides. Toy story land surprised me with how enjoyable the rides there were. The live shows were absolutely amazing and worth the wait! I don't think it's necessary to be waiting exactly when they suggest but at least a 10min before the start of the show. *our wait times might be skewed because we went on a Wednesday on a very very hot June day (weather channel said it felt like 105oF the day we went).There are many good food options for people but there was only limited air conditioned seats so we opted to buy hotdogs from a stand and stayed under the shade for a quick bite to eat. Try the mango juice there, it tastes so good and is super refreshing on a hot day!We didn't get a chance to watch the parades  fireworks because it was so hot outside that we wanted to do all the rides and buy some souvenirs before heading back to our hotel. The shops on main street have a ton of promos for people that like souvenirs and even have us some stickers and a small notepad as gifts.When we left we were invited to do a survey and got a ton of hong kong disneyland souvenirs! If we head back to Hong Kong, we will definitely go to disneyland again...but maybe this time try to come in winter to avoid that heat :)",Disneyland_HongKong
135025535,4,missing,Australia,We enjoyed the day and loved the rides. Toy Story land was the kids favourite with my six year old taking the challenge of Andy's toy car. Very scary.  Don't think she will do that again in a hurry.   Thanks for great day out.,Disneyland_HongKong
123280908,4,2011-12,Singapore,"We visited Paris disneyland in Dec 2011, Disneyland is always Disneyland, beautiful and magical , no matter which country you visit, the difference is only in the language. My advice for tourists are to purchase the tickets online ( where there is a discount ) or using the Paris Viste ticket to purchase on the counter where discount is provided. Otherwise the tickets for walk in can be expensive, Adult is     71.00 and Child     64.00, for a single day pass for 2 parks ( including Walt Disney Studio).My understanding is the the locals ( French) got a even better discount from the tickets. So do your homework to get a good price. Overall, nice experience, not overly crowded . We need not use the fastpass at all during this period. With Christmas theme in the Disneyland, it is really special !",Disneyland_Paris
178742836,4,2013-9,United States,"Well, first off we love Disney, no matter which park or state you go to it in, its always fun. I have to say though, I did like Disney California adventure more than Disneyland and I liked Disney World better than both. Disneyland tries to keep it as close to original as possible, with all the staff wearing old fashioned garb. There was a ton to do in the park, we never did get to finish it all. The thing that made me sad about this park though, is their lack of fast passes, not all rides have them, as matter of fact, only a couple do. Unlike Disney world, there is also no real pin trading here, none of the staff wears trading pins.. but yet they are still sold in the park stores, it was kind of disappointing. Other than that we had a great time. ",Disneyland_California
277626290,5,2015-6,United States,"I am an annual pass holder and live near Disneyland so it is a convenient place for me to go. I enjoy the atmosphere and all the different food and scenery.

225144119,5,2014-8,United Kingdom,"Had a fantastic time in Disneyland Paris. All the family enjoyed the trip. Stayed for three nights at Camp Davy Crocett.So glad we had the early passes to see all the attractions cause its so busy.Disney fast pass is brilliant to be able to do all the rides.I was upset about the princesses having to queue to get a ticket to go back later to queue again to see them. But worth it for the smile on the kids faces.Yes Disney is busy but with planning and early mornings and late nights you can see and do everything. Enjoy the magic Also the half board option is great value for money, even includes a afternoon snack and drink.",Disneyland_Paris
248192557,3,2014-12,Singapore,"Yes, it was the holidays, but it felt like the whole world was at Disneyland. It was so crowded that it was difficult to walk and queues were super long. It was not a pleasant experience.",Disneyland_California
349095785,3,2016-2,United Kingdom,"First of all you had to keep reminding yourself that Disney Land is for children and that ladies wrapped in shawls and mutton cloth can never be nine years old again.So force yourself to lap up the romantic doey eyed view of Paris and be enthralled in the jungle of concrete slabs and thermoplastic injected fantasy.This may be difficult when you have been waiting line for a bag of cold skinny fries which really kicks the hell out of the idea of Fast Food.Oh my dear monsieur, sacre bleu, 7 Euros for a beer ! vache sacree ! good job this is not real proper money like what we spend in Blighty.Another beer please.... Une autre biere s`il vous plait.... was not a linguistic phrase that was uttered very often at that price for half a jar of swamp water.Enjoy yourself with the family and for a few fleeting moments forget about the credit card bills waiting on the door mat to welcome your joyful return.",Disneyland_Paris
140732182,5,2012-9,Malaysia,"Make sure you plan your trip perfectly otherwise you can't finish everything in one day. The themepark is not too big, can be easily finished in one day. I'm going there with family and this is my first Disneyland. We ate breakfast before going into the park, as the food cost around 60~80HKD. A lot awesome rides you must not missed. A lot stuff is written and spoke in Cantonese. It's just unforgettable as a first timer.",Disneyland_HongKong

429061068,3,2016-9,Philippines,"This is not my first Disneyland. I've also been to Disney in Orlando and also Universal Studios and I remember those as being fun even if I went there when I was already 27. But this Disney is smaller and the rides are less   scary and thrilling. It really is a wonderland for kids. My 12 year old niece enjoyed it but me, not as much. Also, when you watch the festival of lights, if ou can't go near from the center, better to be at the center even if you are far away. That way, you can still see the fireworks. We decided to go near but at the side and was only able to see once part of the castle, the other part was blocked from view.",Disneyland_HongKong
303702131,1,2015-8,United Arab Emirates,"I really felt bad for our kids since we have spent more time in waiting than playing , the queue for each game was more than 1 hour so we got tired easily and discovered the day was over without enjoying as much as we wanted . it will not make any difference if you come early or late to Disney since you will maximum play 3 games anyway for being tired from the long waiting .we just took it as a onetime experience and for sure we will not come back . don   t stay late before the closing as the train can get full and for sure you are tired and have to wait for another queue to go back home .",Disneyland_Paris
130102931,5,2011-9,Canada,"A trip to Disneyland is a fantastic family holiday. Rather than watch your kids enjoy themselves at a children's attraction, Disney creates a world that is also very entertaining and nostalgic for adult to participate in as well. There are wild and tame rides, shows, music, static attractions, shopping, tasty food and games. I have been there twice, once in mid May and once in late September. Crowds were low and lines were short most of the time. Sometimes we could walk on a ride within 5 minutes but during the afternoon and on weekends, the lineups were longer. It is a pricey trip but I feel that it was worth it. Take snacks and drinks as the food prices in the park are high for those items. Learn about the Fast Pass system and use it, even if you don't think the park is busy. The morning is slower, so grab passes for the afternoon, when the lines are longer. The fastpasses will indicate a timeframe to return but we found that they are actually good for that entire day. We are planning another trip for this fall. If I could afford it, I would visit the park every year.",Disneyland_California
168942995,5,2013-7,United States,"I just love Disneyland!!! It really makes me forget about any worries, because it just is such a magical place to be. I feel like a kid again and I just love to see my daughter's face full of excitement. I love that unique smell and feeling of excitement when you first enter the park. It really is like entering a different world, where you leave your worries behind. I really like how much attention to detail there is. It is always very clean and the cast members are always smiling, only once was there one that definitely needed some pixie dust. But hey, they are human after all, and who knows what was afflicting him that day. I also appreciate that they can accommodate to people with special needs and also that some of their restaurants do have glutten free options. The prices are high, won't deny that, but I do think that you do get what you pay for. Just a wonderful time!! I do feel blessed that I have been able to enjoy it with my family a couple of times and I really hope that everyone can enjoy it at least once in their lifetime.",Disneyland_California
553450312,5,2017-12,United States,"My family of 2 adults and 2 kids (age 12,14) visited Disneyland on Christmas Eve. We arrived at 7:30 and we   re allowed into the park at 7:45 but not able to ride any attractions until rope drop. My son was first in line for the Matterhorn Bobsleds, my husband was able to get a handmade candy cane made fresh that day, my daughter and Were the first to ride Peter Pan, and It   s a Small World. The original rides here that Walt made are old school but still amazing( Alice in Wonderland, Mr. Toad, and Storyland Canals). We loved these rides. We loved all the intricate details of the park, how much longer the rides were compared to Disney World ( Pirates if the Caribbean) and that the lines seemed to move quickly even though the park was crowded. The Christmas decorations were very pretty as well as the castle lit up at night. We enjoyed our visit and look forward to going back. ",Disneyland_California
189934454,3,2014-1,United Kingdom,"We visited the park for New Years Eve 2013 staying a total of 4 days. This was our fifth visit but certainly the worst. The whole point of going to Disneyland is for the magic of Disney and the whole Christmas celebrations seemed to detract from this rather than enhance this. The main Christmas themed evening display was nice to see but not as good as the one we saw on our last visit in October 2012. In addition to this the park was packed to the point where you were continuously battling your way through crowds, huge restaurant queues and massive ride queues. Nearly all the queues in the park for the large rides were way to long averaging 1.5 hours plus for most of our stay. It was also annoying to find queue jumping and people standing right up against the back of you in queues. Fast passes are a great idea but most of them joint the standard queue in a way that you felt like you were pushing in, there were no staff helping to filter you through, instead you simply had to push your way in. Not sure why the Disney Paris management thinks this is acceptable in Europe but not in the USA. The rides as ever were great fun and the themeing is second to none, but the park falls short of the Magic Kingdom in Florida and the original Disneyland park in LA. Thunder Mountain broke down on three of the four days we were in the park which was disappointing. On the last day we waited 45 minutes even with our Fast Passes due to it breaking down and reopening causing a huge backlog of people.Probably the most annoying thing about this visit (that I have never noticed before) was the vast amount of people smoking all over the park; in queues (those outside and those inside), in the toilets, parades, shows and the doorways to restaurants and shops. I have no issue with people smoking affecting their own health but if there are smoking areas people should stick to these areas. The Disney staff did not seem to challenge members of the public smoking despite no smoking signs on nearly all the queues.Will not be visiting the Paris Disneyland Park any time soon and will never visit during peak time as its not worth it as the park standards slip. If you have to go during peak time go to Florida Disney parks as they are better managed and more enjoyable.",Disneyland_Paris
137874380,3,2012-8,Australia,"My 4.75 year old and I visited HK Disneyland during Chinese school holidays which meant it was hot, humid and crowded. Average wait time for rides was close to 1 hour which is a big ask for a little person. When we did get in (had some problems with the vouchers I purchased through Expedia) the Customer Relations gave us some  Fast Passes  for a few rides. This was definitely the way to go because it meant we only had to wait about 10 15 minutes for the rides (Buzz Lightyear & Pooh Bear). A good tip is also to go on the rides as a 'single' because it's about 1 4 the wait time compared to going in a group especially Space Mountain. It's also handy to buy an Octypus train pass so you don't have to que up to buy single tickets when returning to your destination.",Disneyland_HongKong
401904294,3,2016-8,United States,"My family and I were so excited to revisit Disneyland. I have always felt it was more quaint, magical and less commercialized than Disney world. However, on this trip, the staff seemedGrumpy and frankly over it. The ticket window lady was super annoyed with our transaction. Several rides were down for refurbishment, which we knew ahead of time. Fast passes are lacking and the wait times begin to become too long. We love Disneyland but felt the original idea and concept is becoming lost. ",Disneyland_California
163328851,5,2013-1,United Kingdom,"Disneyland, the happiest place on earth! It's exhausting but it really is a great time. We were travelling as a couple, so no kids with us, and we managed to plan the whole day out to make sure we barely had to wait in any lines. We arrived first thing in the morning and went straight to the rides that are notorious for having long lines. We waited for ten minutes for Space Mountain, 5 minutes for the Star Wars Ride, 15 minutes for Indiana Jones, 2 minutes for Pirates of the Caribbean... So many people say to do these rides later in the day, but for us, 8am was the best time to do them. The park got really busy around 10.30 so before that there weren't huge lines to wait in. We also made use of the fast pass which was really great and on our tickets we got one magic morning which we used to wait in the lines of the rides we had missed out on the short rides of previously like the Matterhorn. We also went through the more kiddie rides then   Peter Pan, The Teacups, It's a Small World, which get really busy later in the day. We got through most of them in an hour and a half because there were no lines which was great. If you get some of those free apps on your phone which show you the waiting time for the rides you can monitor them the days before you go and decide which rides you'll rush to first thing. It really helps and saves a lot of time.The other thing to do is to go on the rides via fast pass late at night, like after the last Fantasia show has finished. There were very few lines then as well. However, leading up to the shows the lines were very long.I was actually disappointed by the Matterhorn...was really slow! LOVED Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain. The fireworks are also some of the best I've ever seen....Disneyland really is an exciting and magical place! I can't wait to take my children there one day!",Disneyland_California

The park is not as big as the one on Orlando but it has fantastic attractions to enjoy with the family. One day of course is not enough to visit all the attractions . I suggest to buy the 2 day pass in order to have plenty time to visit all the wonderful themed worlds around the park.My favorite , the mine roller coaster!! Before the park closes its door at around 8:30 pm , there is an amazing fireworks show which is the perfect way to close this unforgivable experience! Thank you Disney!",Disneyland_HongKong

We have never had a annual passport so we decided this year to get one so we could spend more time with the kids who always have one and we've had a blast. We don't know if we will get one again, (price is kinda high) but we will enjoy it all the same.

We took our grandchildren to LA last week and felt obliged to shell out $400 for Disney Park tickets. What a shambles. The park is clean, the personnel are professional and pleasant and the rides work if you can get on them...but you can't. Standing in giant line ups we were surrounded by piped music, exposed to broiling sun and the less than charming aroma of fast food.I accept that millions of people seem to enjoy this although I am at a loss to understand why, so I will buy shares in Disney but I will never go back!",Disneyland_California
623908588,5,2018-10,Australia,I had been to Disneyland when i was 12 and was so excited that i could return with my husband and 2 boys 12 and 15.We all had an amazing time. MUST fast pass.....and if you can avoid taking a bag your entry is faster.Only disappointment waa that we didnt really see the characters much and the parades were pixar only. Would have loved to have seen the older characters such as goofy and Pinocchio in a parade.That being said if you did spot a character you could line up for a pic. I would love to see tge characters just wandering around main street near each land entry for most the day.Park was very clean and even though it was very crowded there was no pushy behaviour.I really hope i am blessed enough that i may return again one day!,Disneyland_California

Yes, it is expensive but when you compare the WHOLE package to other theme parks, other parks do not even come close to being anything that Disney is. Cast members are ALL friendly, smiles on faces, helpful, seem to really enjoy themselves. Lines might be long for some rides but lines move quickly. We were there the opening day of CARS. Didn't get to ride Cars but I'm sure it will be there the next time I go back. This is truly a magical place. Helpful hint you can bring in your own food and drinks! You can also leave to rest or eat at McDonald's (across street with reasonable prices) as long as your hand is stamped and you have your tickets. After visiting a Disney restroom, other restrooms cannot even compare to the cleaniness of Disney. Park is always spotless.Very family friendly, handicapped friendly, elderly friendly, newly wed friendly (saw three newly wed couples on visit), EVERYONE friendly place.One prior visit was with a group of handicapped adults. Cast members were more than accommodating.

214074998,3,2014-6,United States,We have been to Walt Disney World in Floridia numerous times and this was our first Disneyland experience. I don't think I would rush back. It feels more like going to any other amusement park really and I think that is just because of how it is really within Anaheim with all the other hotels etc. so close. We prefer how the Floridia park is so spread out that we feel like we are in a whole other world. We didn't get that feeling with Disneyland. And the staff here I think they need to go back to customer service school! What a difference in the helpfulness and attitude of the staff here compared with Disney World. My husband was sent on a wild goose chase by two seperate staff members while trying to get lunch for my son. Come to find out the place they were directing him to was OUTSIDE the park but no one explained that to him. This park is also smaller and the locals definately go often so it gets crowded which I guess is typical for any Disney park but it just felt worse because there wasn't as much space for people to spread out within the park.,Disneyland_California

The shows are simply superb, but provided you can see them after standing in the queue. Best to reach there as soon as Disneyland opens. Direct trains from Paris are there. Ice cream was delicious. Lots of food parlous available. Plan your trip through this based on the timing of the shows. The brochure at the entrance, along with the tickets will give you the details of the show timings for the day. Enjoy the Disney parade. I wish there were more rides though and definitely more intelligent rides. The shows should also be increased to accommodate more people. Else, it becomes a waste of lot of money.",Disneyland_Paris

We bought a 3 day pass one park per day which was very expensive but of course, worth it. California Adventure Park was awesome, the new additions like Paradise Pier and Cars Land were outstanding. The rides were great and we never ran into one employee who wasn't friendly or smiling. There are lots of choices for food and drinks, again pricey but to be expected. It was dissapointing that the Grizzly Rapids were closed on such a hot day. Seems like a ride that should be closed down during the less busy, colder months. World of Color was amazing! The next 2 days we spend in Magic Kingdom and it was very busy and very hot, but we still had a great time! the one thing the park lacks during very hot days are air conditioned places to eat or sit to escape the heat. The food line ups were always very long and it seemed to take forever to get any food we ordered. Better off just grabbing a hot dog from the vendor. The rides were awesome, we were able to take our 1.5year old on almost every one and she loved them! All the employees were very friendly and always helpful and smiling. The only negative about this experience were the amount of rides closed down, again seems strange to close down such popular rides such as pirates of the caribbean during such a busy time. There were at least 5 more rides that were closed too. The parade was awesome, the fireworks were awesome too!! We cant wait to come back!",Disneyland_California

5805311,4,missing,Australia,"I chose to fly my family of 5 from South Australia to California for a two week trip of a lifetime. I went to Disneyland when I was 8 in 1976 and I believed all children (and adults) should have that experience. It truly is magical. Our holiday was in the first two weeks of December 2005 and the weather was perfect, everyday, beautiful sunshine but cool nights. Arriving at the Howard Johnson Hotel (seperate review) in the afternoon we chose to dine in Downtown Disney before dedicating the next full day in the US to Disneyland. We loved the Rainforest Cafe but the whole atmosphere in Downtown was great, with beautiful lighting decorations for Christmas. We had 5 day hopper passes for the Disney Parks (which included California Adventure). Disneyland is just a fantastic place, it really was an experience for our whole family. We all had our favourite attractions   Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, Buzz Lightyear, Haunted Mansion to name a few. The park was spotlessly clean, the staff were polite and helpful, and the attention to detail just amazed me and the characters were great. We loved the 50th Anniversary firework display, brilliant! and the Fast Pass option really helped. There were a couple of issues though which have stopped me from giving the park a five star rating, which is no fault of anyone   1. There were just too many baby strollers which really got in way and 2. When it got crowded, it really did get beyond a usual busy crowd, it became a headache. Luckily when it did we just 'hopped' over to Cal. Advent Park next door and although I thought that was excellent too, it wasn't nearly as crowded. This holiday is something we, or our kids will not forget, with plenty of photos and video they can relive it over and over. And yes we are planning another trip there already.",Disneyland_California

293452327,2,2015-7,Australia,"There is no doubt that any parent would feel that the money is worth it when they see the sparkle in their daughters as they see Disney princesses. However, overall we were disappointed with Disney Land Park. Having recently been to Universal Studios in Singapore, we'd had high expectations. Unfortunately the age of Disney Paris is showing and the lack of modern technology in the rides is evident. You could overlook the dated nature of the place, as they clearly can't be updating it all the time. But what we could not overlook is an overt attempt to gouge every last cent out of you. When it came to lunch time, there were no simple stalls to be seen where you could get a hot dog or a sandwich (we eventually saw one at 5pm). You are effectively forced to eat in one of their over priced restaurants. We settled for their  fine American all you can eat buffet.  For EUR30 per adult and EUR17 for a child above 3 years of age you got to eat very average food   oh and ONE glass of soft drink! For those of you with young children you will probably share the pain of even getting your children to eat (and don't think of your kids simply eating what you bring with you if you want to go in   they charge you at the door as you walk in!). This was after a poor experience on the ticketing. We booked the Mini Ticket which allows access to both Parks in Low season for a day. Unfortunately we had to postpone our trip due to an emergency and had to move it to high season. Their website tells you that you can top up if you want to use the ticket in high season. What they don't tell you is that you don't top up to the two park high season price   you have to pay much more. So be it, but it would be better if the website is a little more transparent on what it means to top up. I only found out after a few calls to their call centre in Paris   it's not shown on the site. All in all, the kids will always remember that they've been to Disneyland, but it would be good if the experience was improved as time goes on so that parents feel it is worth the price.

291634694,5,2015-6,United States,"Let's face it... no one likes long lines and big crowds. Especially with little ones. And not all rides are created equal. But... it's DISNEYLAND! So make the most of it, and enjoy the magic!Most important tip: GET FAST PASS TICKETS! They do NOT cost extra! You simply scan your entry ticket at the kiosk near the rides that offer a fast pass. Your Fast Pass will tell you what time to return to that ride, and then you'll enjoy a MUCH shorter  fast pass line!  Seriously... I think the most we waited in line was about 20 25 minutes. Most rides, we pretty much walked right on! As we'd pass by hundreds of people waiting in the regular line, I figured they just didn't know... Now, it's important to know that not ALL rides offer Fast Passes. You can download an app or look at the Disneyland brochure to help you plan ahead! (You can even get a fast pass for the Fantasmic night show; it will get you into the closest section near the water.)Also, Fast Passes are great if you have young children with you. For most rides, my husband and I would take turns going on it with the older kids, while the other parent was on double stroller duty. We would get Fast Passes for our littlest kids, too, but we'd just use those passes to take the older kids on the ride again. There ARE a few rules... like you can only have fast passes for one or two rides at a time (I'm not entirely sure of the details). After you use it, you can get more passes. You'll get the hang of it quickly, and it'll save hours of waiting in those long lines... which will make MORE time for selfies, parades, and churros! :)",Disneyland_California

This helps move the lines along. Plenty of food options but expect fun park prices. You are of allowed to use selfie sticks in either park but plenty of staff are happy to take your photo for you. Would recommend the hopper pass   enables you to move between Disney and California park. Only real negative is that they don't operate a  hopper  line   so each time you leave on park to go to the other   you have to line up again at the main entrance   this was rather frustrating when the whole point of the hopper pass is to move back and forth. ,Disneyland_California

I don't think you can just rock up there and magically expect to get the most out of the experience and, lets face it, it's an expensive experience when you travel from Australia, unless you put a little effort into the planning. I absolutely love the early mornings into the park and I think it is well worth staying at a Disney hotel so that you can get early morning entry every day into either Disneyland or California Adventure Park. We always stay at the Grand Californian as it is the most convenient. The staff at Disney are wonderful and each  world  has the cast members dressed in that attire eg the cars world staff are all dressed like formula 1 racers. Disney caters very well for people with food issues   our son is coeliac and at each restaurant the chef came out and personally spoke to us and then prepared our son's meal. At a few places, the chef even went  off menu  to accommodate us. Once, the chef came out to the table, saw that our son had polished off the meal very quickly and prepared him another one free of charge! Yes Disney is expensive and yes you can go to cheaper places but I will guarantee you that everywhere else will feel second rate after you have done Disney. Plan your day. Use the early morning entry and you will get a heap of rides done in that first hour. Use the fast pass system to get onto other popular rides. Whatever you do, don't miss out on riding radiator springs racers at night. It is spectacular!(use the fast pass system for this.) There is a stack of information you can get online about Disneyland that will help with planning your trip.

Reading the previous negative reviews for the same visiting period, which do not match our great experience, I list below a few simple tips to make the most out of your visit. 1. Stay in a Disneyland hotel, have breakfast early (e.g. 07:30) and enjoy the 2 extra hours that the Park is open only for hotel guests (from 08:00   10:00 ).2. Do your internet search before going and plan the attractions you want to visit if you have limited time available. To me the most joyfull and of course popular ones are: In Disneyland Park (i) Peter Pan's flight, (ii) Pirates of the Carribean, (iii) Thunder Mountain Roller Coaster and in Disney Studios (i) Rock 'n Roller Coaster Aerosmith, (ii) Toy Story Parachute jump (iii) The Stunt's 45 mins show3. Timing and location is everything when visiting so do read the programs, be there 20 minutes earlier before the shows and DO USE the FASTPASS whenever available. It is better to wait in line for 10 mins to get a fastpass rather than 1  hours in minus 5 degrees. For those complaing about the long queues, I wonder if they used the fastpass. Go and gather the more fastpasses you can and then plan the sequence of rides accordingly, spending time for shopping and dinning. 4. If you are there only for 1 2 days and you have spent so much money... buy the Premium VIP fastpass at 60EUR per person to get immediate access at every attraction. I saw people entering from the  exit , flashing their VIP fastpasses to the attaction handler and getting immediately in front of every raw.5. The prices for dining are indeed a rip off. So, make sandwitches or have some snacks for the kids. Many people was preparing them from the hotel buffet breakfast... It's far better to have a good breakfast and snacks during the day, rather than loose more time in queues for the restaurants, even with reservation.6. Stay until the closing time. People leave half an hour early to avoid the rush... BUT that's the best time to visit attractions that had the longest queue. We did Buz Lightyear flashing gunshot 4 consecutive times just before the closing time. During the day the waiting time was never below 40 mins for a single ride.7. Read the programs for special parades events like Fantillusion which was available only until 06 January and started 5mins after the official closing time of the park !!! 8. If you have many days availalble start your day early, spent the morning for the extra 2 hours, then get the train to Paris at 10:15 You will be there before 11:00... visit Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum and or shopping at Gallerie Lafayette behind Opera (BTW: dining at 6th floor offers great views of Paris). If you get the RER A train back to Marne La Vallee in the evening you may still have time to re enter the park for 1 2 attractions.9. The purpose of the visit are the Parks but leave a couple of hours, ideally during the last day of your visit that you have visited everything in the Parks, to go to Marne la Vallee Outlet village. It's 5 miles away and depending on the season you can really find great bargains at 60% discounted prices. If you find items that you would buy anyway at normal retail prices, then that shopping can even compensate the expenses of your whole trip.10. Buffalo Bill's Dinner Show is heavily advertised but it is overrated. Still, it is a different experience that the kids will enjoy and the food is plenty and good.Enjoy your visit, do not let  queues by passers  to spoil your mood and be prepared for an upwards budget spending.",Disneyland_Paris
140967757,5,2012-9,United States,"What can I say other then my title? We love Disneyland! It is the happiest place on earth and I look forward to our annual trip! Use the Fastpass system, take advantage of the  Rider switch off  if you have small children (one parent waits with child and when the parent on the ride is done they switch), use the single rider option if possible it will save A LOT of time. Yes they have an off season but it still is busy, so make a plan and tackle it with some speed so you don't miss anything!",Disneyland_California

605793740,2,2018-8,Israel,"Very disappointing attitude. I visited the park with my wife and 3 teens last wednesday (8 8 18). Got a disabled pass of the highest degree since I am...hmmm...disabled. After four hours in the park, while exiting the Buzz lightyear ride, my left knee got slammed hard against the ride   s troley. I suffered pains in my knee which slowed us all down, and for the rest of the day I mostly sat down, and we all missed the disney studios park which we also bought tickets to. Bit there   s more.At evening time when it was really blue and swollen and aching, I went to the park   s infirmary and they treated me the best they could. I thought that disney will assume responsibility, But oh How I was wrong. When we asked the park to let us revisit the Disney studios park later this week (didn   t ask our money back, didn   t say we will sue or anything, just to come back at a later day) we were absolutely shocked to Their refusal. The reason: it took me too long to come and see the doctor (a whole 3 hours or so) after the incident. So, hey, what do you think about that?",Disneyland_Paris

Very atmospheric the Aladin passage with the eastern type music, restaurants, nicely lightened up in the night. Blue lagoon place you thought you were somewhere else. Big lines for all games when you have a young kid ( 4 years ) it is hard to wait 40 minutes to get to an attraction game for 1 minute ( very short rides for such a long wait ). The parades very nice, the small world attraction excellent,dreamy!! It was disappointing to spend 4 days in Disneyland and not have a sunny one!!!Generally crowdy, packed and very commercial ( you had to buy things all the time ) I thing the kid had fun and new experiences although got tired a lot.",Disneyland_Paris
269952788,5,2015-4,United Kingdom,"My son & I found every second of Disneyland amazing! There is naturally a lot of queueing for rides but this is expected and does not take away from the experience. Both the Easter Parade and the daily parade were great fun and ran like clockwork! The palace is beautiful and a lovely place to look around. On Main Street there are some great places to eat, drink and shop. I think you need at least a few days to explore every corner of this park!The highlight for us was the Disney firework and animation show. It was beyond what I had imagined. It's more than fireworks; it is a fantastic show, combining as many Disney characters as they could within twenty minutes. The animations projected onto the castle blow me away!",Disneyland_Paris

187096630,2,2013-8,United States,"We took our two 9 year old boys to Disneyland in August. For two days, one park each day, it cost just over $700 in tickets for two adults and two kids. That was entry tickets only. We chose the Disneyland park for the first day. We arrived around 8am and rode the Indiana Jones ride first. As we were exiting the ride, it broke down, so we couldn't ride it again. The Pirates of the Caribbean was also not working, and the haunted house wasn't working. We eventually were able to ride Pirates and the haunted house, but when we came back on our Fast Pass to ride Indiana Jones, it again wasn't working, so we didn't get to ride it. We also really wanted to see the Abe Lincoln exhibit because our boys love history. We tried to get in, but there was a private party, so we weren't allowed in. We couldn't go to the Lincoln exhibit on our second day at the park, because the second day ticket was good only at California Adventure. I didn't buy the more expensive tickets that would have allowed us to go to both parks each day because I knew we didn't have the energy to do both parks in one day. I didn't realize so many attractions would not be working or closed like the Lincoln exhibit. It's also crazy that we'd have to pay more for the two day two park ticket because of Disney's problems! The second day we went to California Adventure. We got there right when the park opened so we could get a fast pass for the new Cars ride. We got the fast pass, but . . . . the ride was broken down. We kept checking the ride throughout the day and finally at around 2:00 pm it was open and we were able to ride it. I felt we paid a lot of money for a frustrating experience. We don't expect to go back.",Disneyland_California
648576865,4,2019-1,Australia,"Disney is amazing ... the place is clean, well run and you certainly don   t lack for something to do.Disney Park is probably more for the smaller kids though, with a lot of the rides being aimed at a younger audience.If you like the thrill rides go next door to Disney   s California Adventure Park.Also, if you are there for a single day, get the Max Pass for $10 as it will give you better access to rides and also digital copies of all Disney and ride photos.And look out for    single rider    spots on the rides ... space mountain had a 45 minute wait, but we got on as single riders (in seperate carriages) in under 5 minutes.",Disneyland_California
493792035,5,2017-6,United Kingdom,Definitely this is th year to go. Parades. Shows. Everything all extra special. Nothing i can fault. Plan your time properly or u will jst wander round in awe not actually achieving anything. Water fountains a godsend. Staff not interfering but helpful if u approach them. Definitely see th illumination show at close. Get a good space at least an hour before but b prepared for ignorant gits blatantly pushing in front of u. Only thing that upset me th whole week was other visitors! Smoking is a big problem. I saw cast members telling them not to and they were arguing back!. Pick your favourite character each day and queue straight away. Way before they start. Same with th train. Plan plan plan. Save save save and u will hav an amazing time ,Disneyland_Paris
180880283,5,2012-12,United States,We stayed at Disney's California Grand Hotel and it's got an entrance to the amusement park. The kids loves Disneyland and they always have so much fun there.

134473552,5,2012-6,United States,"Who couldn't love disneyland, it's the happiest place on earth, but it would be much happier if they didn't charge so much. Really $125? That's outrageous!!! Not everybody makes $90K  a year. A lot of peple don't even make 1 2 that. And if it's a single income family, how could you ever expect them to buy 4 bottles of water at $4.00 each. Thats 2hours of pay for some people. Walt wanted everyone to be able to afford a visit there. Rich and Poor it didn't matter. Look at that park bench that he used to sit at when his daughters were playing. Do you think it would cost him almost $400.00 to take his kids to the park for 1 day? That man is turing over in his grave at the greedy COE and corporate admin that has made disney a dirty word",Disneyland_California
624116749,4,2018-10,United States,Today was a great day for Disneyland! Rides were anywhere from 5 to 60 minutes long.

There are different things for everyone to have fun; some exhilarating rides, some sweets games, spectacular shows and parades! I would recommend to take your own autograph book, as the ones sold there are too simple and overpriced. The Disneyland app makes life so much easier! It tells you on real time exactly where to find character and timings, the waiting time for each ride, where to find toilets, etc. ",Disneyland_California
377890022,5,2015-8,India,A fun for kids easy to reach and return booking on line may save you from the long queue the food outlets were pretty much expensive those who have been to other Disney lands may find this very small and not worth. the staff looked as f they were miffed by the atmosphere. They should be well trained in order to avoid unfriendliness; since it ought to be the happiest place.,Disneyland_HongKong
187926643,5,2013-1,Australia,"The saying that Disneyland is the most happiest place one earth is really true. My family and I visited Disneyland early this year when the christmas parades were still commencing, and we lucky enough to see one. It was absolutely amazing and truly a magical experience for my parents, sisters and myself. Disneyland really is a great experience for people of all ages. Theres if plenty of food for everyone and a great variety of places to eat. The service everywhere is exceptional and every staff member is so friendly. To top all the experiences off the rides were the highlight of our time. Every ride was so much fun, creative and different. Some were scary, some were easy but every single one was so much fun! I recommend it for anyone but especially families. The waits for the rides were pretty good also as even though we were there around Christmas and New Year the longest wait was just over an hour and it was well worth it after the end of the ride. Space Mountain is fantastic as well as Splash Mountain. These two rides were my favourite. Try get up early and get to the park as soon as it opens as you can get to a few rides with no lines even if it is the busier time of the year. Definitely go to Disneyland, its well worth it and fantastic as Christmas.",Disneyland_California
272076254,5,2015-5,Sri Lanka,"We were rather skeptical whether this was for adults although many friends had said it is a must do in Hong Kong. I must say we are converts and firmly believe it is a must go irrespective of age specially if you have grown up with these Disney characters. We took the MTR to Sunny Bay and then got on the free Disney Resort Line Rail that takes you to the attraction. We visited on a weekday yet there was quite a crowd on the train and near the ticket booths by 11.15AM. So I suggest it is a good idea to be there by 10.30AM itself when it opens. Best to get grab a map of the location with times for various shows & parades so you don't miss them. The Lion King Show was simply amazing and I almost danced and sang to it! Both parades were nice and if you plan to stay till late do stay for the fireworks at 9pm as well. Fantasy Land is probably the most attractive for small kids. It is best to cover Fantasy Land, Adventure Land & Mystic Point & grizzly Gluch earlier in the day as some attraction close by 6.00pm and Fantasy land also certain attractions were said to close earlier in preparation for the fireworks display. Toy Story land & Tomorrow Land on the other hand the rides are open till about 7.30 8.30pm. It's a Small World ride was really nice and the attention to detail was breath taking. Since I am not a thrill seeker I did not do the more daring rides but there are about 3 such rides available for the daring few.The queues for shows tend to start 30min early so best to get there by then and if you wish to take photographs of the parades and fireworks best to consider a vantage point and be there early. This is a full day visit and considering it is a weekday however, weekends probably are much more busier. They also do not allow you to take any food in so be prepared to spend a bit more on food.",Disneyland_HongKong
646284593,4,2018-12,United Kingdom,"We took our two young children to Disney for Christmas as a surprise. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, however there are a couple of things to note:Positives: Fastpast is great for the busier rides.Great selection of Characters out on site.Staff very friendly and helpful.Great choice of rides.Fireworks display is incredible.Negatives:We found the Christmas parade a little disappointing. Not many characters and not as big as the normal parade.Fireworks went off at different times each night and so we only got to watch them once as we kept missing them.The new App to book Spiderman   Buzz etc. is insane. You can only book one character experience at a time and if you are on there one minute past 9:45am you've missed them all! I got on there straight away and managed to get a slot for Spiderman, however it wasn't until 5.30pm!!Breakfast with Mickey: Paid extra and Mickey didn't even show up.

Lots of character appearances for photo ops & the parade & evening fireworks are not to be missed. In all honesty, it's not as good as Orlando but still a lot of fun. TIP: Buy the maxpass for $10.

293707221,5,2015-7,Australia,Whilst I have been to disneyworld in America and yes it is obviously bigger and better Disneyland Paris was great! We went at peak time and our maximum wait time was about 70 minutes which you kind of have to expect at most theme parks. The atmosphere was great although wanted an early dinner around 5pm and every food place we chose to stop at were closing for some reason and wouldn't tell us why just told us to leave eventually found somewhere though. Also whilst there are dedicated smoking areas it appears no one seemed to care and there was a lot of smoking which I think needs to be addressed because it was rather a turn off especially around small children.,Disneyland_Paris

The new CARS land is a nice addition, buy your tickets on line and print them or pick them up at the gate for a small discount.

65708209,4,missing,United Kingdom,"I cannot stress enough that if you are going to Disneyland Paris in May do your homework! We were a family party of eight (two of whom were toddlers), staying at the Disney Hotel on the park. We were not told by Disney nor our travel agent that many attractions would be closed for renovation and that the park closed to everyone at 6pm. Whilst disappointed not to see the 9pm parade and the fireworks and not to experience rides such as the Studio Tour, Dumbo, etc. we did find that by 6pm the little ones had had enough. Be prepared for some shows to be narrated in French with no English translation shown.The one advantage of going at this time of year, before English schools holiday, is that the Park is very comfortable and little time is wasted in long tiring queues. The longest queue we experienced was Autopia at 40mins   a one off. My sister visited last August and for most rides they waited for well over an hour. We were able to see most of the attractions without delay and did not need to use our Fastpasses very often. Disney in our view, is not geared to healthy eating   fresh orange was the only drink without sugar and for vegetarians a cheese salad or pizza was the only choice. We did find a jacket potato stall in Frontierland but the cheese was indescribable! The park is spotlessly clean with litter patrols operating non stop. The toilets were not always as clean so take plenty of anti bacterial gel. Food and drink are expensive and not particularly good quality but one expects that on a captive site such as this. For a bottle of water expect to pay about   2.30 For a lunchtime snack 'deal'   pizza,salad,drink expect to pay   11 each.The staff on the park are friendly and very helpful. The medical centre cannot be praised highly enough. All in all a fantastic experience for the little ones with the parades and the Disney characters wandering around the park. For older thrill seekers some great rides very similar to Alton Towers but at twice the expense . If travelling by Eurostar with pushchairs expect one very slow lift and a long wait to get out of the station at Disney as the only other method of reaching ground level is by escalators which one cannot do with pushchairs and baggage. Compared to the child friendly walkway escalators at St Pancras the Eurostar station at Disney leaves a lot to be desired.",Disneyland_Paris

There were a lot to see but a minus is that the Disney characters did not go around. They had this places and special times where you could meet them. I was a lot of people in March and this was not high season. The tickets were expensive because children over 11 had to pay fullPrice. For one day, one ticket 90 euro.A plus was that everything is included in the ticket so if you want to go on the roller coaster you could.The line to some of the entertainments were huge and you could stand in line for up to an hour.Well hmm it is something to see for sure but for me as an adult well maybe some and some not. More plus were that the had smoking areas so people did not go around smoking.A minus is that some people did go around smoking anyway. I can say that if you go to Paris you have to see Disneyland as well. Just because :) The food were ok inside but not wow and the meals could easily go up to 50 60 euro for 4 persons.

The hassle of getting there through the thousands of cars, getting shuffled out to park in the boondocks, waiting to get on a shuttle, standing in line once you get to the park to get in, and then standing in line all day for the attractions.

132658361,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from a three day trip with our two daughters (4 and 2 years old). They had such a good time, when it was time to go home there were tears.Bearing in mind it was still school term time the train from the UK was full. The park seemed busy but the average queue time during our time there was 40 minutes. There was ample of opportunities to meet your favourite Disney characters but our first tip is to tell your kids to HUSTLE! If they don   t there will be tears and no one will care. This is Disneyland in France where fully grown adults go without children and will think of nothing to push past  move aside  stand in front of your 4 year old child (whom will wait so politely and patiently) so they can see a guy in a suit. If like us you spend time teaching your children manners, for couple of days while you are at Disney, you will have to tell them to set them aside or they will never see anything! This mainly relates to the spontaneous character encounters and waiting for the parades  shows where there are no queuing systems. Literally adults and groups of young adults and teenagers push past all the little children to see the costumed character. Before you know it they have to go and your children are left crying and asking why Mickey didn   t say Hello but was messing around with the adults. Where I think this is sad and these adults must have lived a sheltered childhood, they have paid to be at Disney and if they want to see Mickey like the children it   s their right. All I am saying is to avoid disappointment tell your kids they will need to hustle!Otherwise there are a number of character meeting opportunities where you have to queue. My daughter managed to fill an autograph book so how anybody can say they never see any characters is beyond me. The most popular character attraction is the Princess Pavilion. The average queuing time was over an hour. Open from 10 to 5, the pavilion is a place where your little princesses can meet the Disney Princesses. Again it amused me to see adult couples queuing to do this, I find it peculiar! Children believe in the magic, and meeting a princess, one to one for cuddles, a chat, photographs and kisses for a 2 year old and a 4 year old it was certainly magical for them. You can however, only meet one at a time, per time queued. There are two different princesses at any one time and they rotate every 25 minutes. Normally they do not tell you who you are going to meet (mainly because the queue monitors do not know) but if you mention which ones you have seen already they will try and make it so you see a different one. The queue spirals up towards the centre where the princesses are, and there are some princess    artefacts    which line some of the way along with the magic mirror, but not enough to keep little princesses amused whilst they are queuing. There is no real quiet time for this attraction and people start queuing for it before it even opens. The princesses (from England) are very good. They seemed to really enjoy what they were doing and understand the joy they give to children. They remembered our daughters when they saw them again around the park and made the effort to say hello again   despite being on strict orders to keep walking and don't stop for toffee.The other newish attraction was meeting Mickey back stage of his Mickey theatre. Again this was a nice and pleasant way of meeting Mickey one to one. You get taken into a private room so there is no pressure from other people waiting in the queue for hugs and photos etc. Whilst you are in the queue you are in Mickey   s theatre and there are Mickey Mouse cartoons playing on the screen on the stage to keep the little ones amused whilst they are waiting. The 20th year light show on the Castle was amazing so if you are going to be there when this is being showed you will not be disappointed. The only downside is that it happens when it gets dark which has been 2230 in the summer months. The show starts at park closing time 2300hrs. People were starting to bag their space in front of the castle from about 2100hr however, since it   s a light show with fireworks, everywhere along main street would give you a good view. The Disney magic on parade was a little disappointing and not as good as the Disney Dreams. They have simply reduced the floats, added a few new tricks but on the whole recycled the old floats with a new song. All the staff were helpful and spoke a number of languages. I agree some of the character actors lacked that certain something that can possibly only be found at the American parks. There just isn't that level of interaction say like in Florida you may expect to see Minnie dancing to 'aint she sweet' in Mainstreet or the wicked witch dishing out insults over by the castle. We have never seen this in Euro Disney. If you are staying at a Disney Hotel we suggest you walk back. By the time you queue and wait for the busses to come (which are every 15 minutes but with the queue at closing time you are sometimes looking around the 4th bus load before you get a look in) you can be tucked in your hotel bed in the mean time. It only takes 15 minutes to walk back to one of the furthest hotels     the Santa Fe. It   s also less stressful as no one gets on the bus when some dude looses their cool and smashes the bus window because he couldn   t get on (as happened on our last visit which prompted us to avoid the buses and explore the walking route). Bring a double buggy. If you have a child still of a buggy age and have another child, consider bring a double buggy. Having the double buggy for our children certainly made a big difference to the kid   s enjoyment. They were able to sit in it in transit between the hotel and parks, the two parks and around the park and also provided as a seat for the parade. It   s a very long day otherwise! Don   t forget to bring a rain cover too! The hire buggies didn   t look practical. They only fit in one child (though some people were pushing adults around in them so they seemed quite robust) and they were simply an uncomfortable looking chair on wheels, so if you have a younger toddler they would be much more comfortable in their own buggy. Bring your own snacks and save money! A trip to the shop before your visit to stock up on sweets and snacks will save having to spend 5euros on a lollypop and such things while you are there. We took a suitcase of snacks and juice for the kids so the money saved on that paid for the little princesses to buy some souvenirs to put in the then empty suitcase to take back home. Even though we took snacks and some drinks, we still spent around 40 euros just on drinks over the 3 days. If you   re on a budget you   re probably best off eating in Mc Donalds in the Disney Village rather than in the park (2 big mac meals and 2 happy meals were 20 euros, 3 burgers at one of the other restaurants were 60 euros!!)Otherwise things like hot dogs are 6.50 euros and bottles of coke are 3.00 euros. Don   t forget to bring your own princess dress or be left being hagged for one at the park which costs 70 euros!We found the park to be nothing but clean and tidy but the toilets do let the park down. The park is now meant to be smoke free save for certain areas however, people widely smoked wherever they liked so watch your little ones don   t get burned as no one has any regard for anyone other than themselves. Smokers also take up seating areas and quite happy stand next to the kids at the parades puffing away in their faces unchallenged by park staff. Autopia was the only ride which was not working during our stay.If you are staying at a Disney hotel you can enjoy the extra magic hours and the main street transportation rides are not so busy at this time. You can enjoy a horse and carriage ride up to the Disney castle. The policies and access for disabled visitors appeared to be very good.All in all we really enjoyed our time and we had tears when it was time to come home. We are already planning our next trip for longer for next year! It will only be magical for children while they are young!",Disneyland_Paris
299437690,5,2015-8,Ireland,"Well that was worth waiting for....best 4 days ever. 3 kids, 2 adults. Two attractions are very popular, princess pavillon and jedi training academy. But if your child really wants to do these you need to be prepared to put in the time to queue up.You have to be at the ticket distribution point at 10am prompt to be in with a CHANCE of getting a ticket, only a certain amount issued per day.For jedi training queue up outside the centre but for princess pavilion just go next to it at the  the old mill  for tickets.

243120753,5,2014-11,Israel,"I visited the park with my youngest son. We took the 7:40 am shuttle from one of the nearby hotels and arrived in time to get a good place in the line. We have never visited a Disney park before and were very excited about this. The gates opened with a huge cheer from the crowd and we ran into this magical place where you can really forget all your troubles. We planned ahead and listed all the rides we wanted to go on, this proved to be an excellent idea. We managed to go on The Pirates of The Caribbean   cool, Indiana Jones   fantastic, splash mountain   woo hoo, Matterhorn bobsleds   really cool, Thunder Mountain railroad   great fun, the Iron man stuff was totally cool, Space mountain left me shaky but my son had a fantastic time. We ate lunch outdoors in one of the many places, there were ducks walking around and we had a great time feeding them. The submarine ride (Finding Nemo) was just a perfect way to wind down and was lovely. We watched the parades, bought gifts in one of the shops and we used a 20% discount voucher hat we got from a food place that we stopped in for some drinks and ice cream, makes sure you check the register slips for discounts. In the evening we took the mono rail which stopped right outside the Lego shop ! Perfect for Lego loving kids and Dads (left me slightly lighter in the wallet department). By 7pm we were totally exhausted and decided to call it a day, actually it was a perfect day. I really really don't care about the cost, it was just so much fun and worth every cent. Can't wait to go there again, it really is a magical place to visit.",Disneyland_California

But mostly you can enjoy being at disney land by just taking it all in, we walked around the park which has different themed areas.

The population has grown and the space on Main Street has not. If you want to watch a show or parade you fins yourself being escorted right off the street and into Frontier Land and can't get back. There are just more and more people and no where for everyone to stand or sit. Disneyland has been outgrown by the crowds. It has no place to expand so everyone gets a chance to see their shows. Demand has overpowered the supply. We tried for 5 nights to really see the Pixar Fest show and each time we ended up getting swooped up and out in the crowd and pushed into Frontier land. All you keep hearing is keep moving keep moving. Then after the shows the same thing you get swept up and out. There are just too many people and no updating on space. It is frustrating and exhausting.",Disneyland_California
534718086,5,2017-10,United Kingdom,"A lot of people will be disappointed when they compare the Paris park to Florida and California, but I really enjoyed my recent three day trip to Disneyland Paris, and I wanted to write a few words about why. Bear in mind that I'm an adult in my early 20's who visited with a friend of a similar age. Neither of us have children and we didn't visit during the school holidays  this may have made things go more smoothly for us!Cast Members: A lot of people complain that CM's at Paris don't have the  American touch  of being overly friendly, but everyone I spoke to was outgoing and helpful. They were, however, more personal: we discussed things like Brexit, the Euro etc., and to a lot of people who like the  escapism  of the US parks, this might be off putting, but I personally loved it. I like talking to the CM's like real people (because they are!) and at no time did any of them make me feel uncomfortable. They were all incredibly knowledgeable about the parks the Disney company whilst still being able to have a  real  conversation with me, and I prefer this relaxed tone. As I said, however, a lot of people want Cast Members to essentially be actors performing roles, and so might not enjoy this, but for me, it was great.Characters: All the characters I met were great fun! CM's were very helpful in taking photos (many took photos of me and my friend interacting with the characters, not just staged poses) and they also gave us sweets, as if we were trick or treating with the characters. How cute! I also didn't have any problems with people pushing in ignoring the queues, which was helped by the CM's directing people to the lines.Food Drink: It's all overpriced, of course, but it's decent, and there's some good salad options for vegans vegetarians that you can find at most of the quick service stops. I had a problem with being charged twice for a salad, but the CM's were apologetic and I was eventually refunded after they found some change! I'd still recommend bringing your own food if you can, though. There's also a decent amount of water fountains in the parks, so bring your own refillable bottle.Merchandise: Honestly, I was quite disappointed with the merchandise on offer. If you're not interested in the core characters (or Stitch!), then a lot of it isn't really tailored to you. However, there's a decent variety of everything you'd expect (sweets, Mickey ears, soft toys etc.), and you can find some things priced more reasonably than others. All the Christmas stuff on display is very sweet, I'd just like to see more villain themed souvenirs. Oh, and more pins!Overall, me and my friend really enjoyed our time at the park, and here are a few tips that I'd pass on, to summarise: Bring your own snacks and a water bottle Avoid visiting in the high season if you can  I'm aware that this will be tricky for parents to do! Bring an autograph book and don't be shy about meeting characters if you're an adult, no one will judge you. It's some silly fun, and you'll get some great photos out of it! Remember that CM's are real people with lives and problems and demands of their own. Don't let them be rude to you, but be relaxed around them. They'll appreciate it!",Disneyland_Paris

I have on my many visits to California visited Disneyland and always seem to be taken back to my childhood, but at the same time be escorted through the generations with the always evolving focus of the Disney Management and Development Team, right up to my last visit a few years ago, which was also fantastic as also my many visits to Disneyworld in Florida. Unfortunately on our trip to California in less then 2 weeks we haven't time to stay over to visit Disneyland and see the developments since our last visit, but hope to visit once again Disneyworld, etc when in Florida for the almost 2 weks we are there. simply if you want to be taken on a ride of the mind, body and spirit, allow a little time for the Disney Universe to share what they have.

Before going next land come back little bit and have lunch etc at Tahiti etc. Can prebook meal coupon from online agent to save money. However do remember to convert printout to meal coupon at entry gate before you enter. Later you cannot. 3 meal option ticket is not good. As snacks is worthless only sweet popcorn or Ice cream.

208869735,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"I absolutely loved Disneyland Paris. We were apprehensive as had read some reviews saying that is was drab and didn't have the same feel to it as the US Disney World. However, it is a beautiful place and although compared to America it is small it is still an amazing experience.Even my husband absolutely loved Disneyland Paris and keeps suggesting a return trip. It is magical and almost feels as though you are in a different world. It is spotlessly clean unlike any theme parks in the UK and the range of rides is also impressive as most theme parks despite claims that they are 'family friendly' have very very few rides for young children. The food is very overpriced however you go to Disneyland expecting this I suppose as you expect this at most family theme parks. The rides, parades, shows etc are all wonderful.Tips:Walt Disney Studios have more organised meet and greets that you can que for (roughly 20 mins) as some people are very rude when the characters are just wandering around and do not wait nicely and shove their children forward to meet characters.If you're eating at McDonalds which gets VERY busy the perfect time is around 4 5. They still have everything in stock at this time and it isn't as hectic. Also, make sure you're in a proper queue and the locals are very rude to any tourists and shove you out of the way if you are accidentally between queues.

325494138,5,2015-11,United Kingdom,Welcome to Disneyland park the home of adventures and annual celebrations . There are always shows and parades going on in the park but it is a lot of ground to cover I recommend a 5 day stay to go home happy that you've had the full experience . The rides are truly mesmerising and a totally new level of awesomeness and fun from average roller coasters . I definitely recommend thunder mountain absolutely captivating and one of my favourites . Also be sure to look out for the vintage hertz cars and buses be careful with the queuing for them as the staff can be funny . There is also a band which is very good they all wear bright colours and should stand out on an average walk through the park . The castle is breathtakingly beautiful way better than on the tv . Also don't forget to take a trip to the Disneyland studios keep an eye out for the characters which are usually there early in the morning so use your hotel pass to get in early for that  tipadvisor When you dream upon a star you're dreams come true    ,Disneyland_Paris
21214980,3,missing,United Kingdom,"Just come back from fourth visit to Eurodisney.  First time went over a weekend and it was manic!!  Second time was just a day trip whilst on holiday elsewhere in France, at Christmas time and it had a magical atmosphere.  Third time was much better, we went by Eurostar and as the kids were older we just had normal luggage (humped around by hubby!) We went Mon to Thurs and it was quieter and we had a good time  Fourth time, again we went Mon to Thurs, it was Halloween theme which they did really well. Loved the parade, we were mainly in fantasyland as my kids don't like rollercoasters and we were with my 2year old niece. We managed to get on all rides within 20mins. The tea cups, we just went and got straight back on each time. It helped that my kids have two weeks half term so we could go the week most schools hadn't broken up yet. I would advise going during term time though, if you are allowed to.Good points: We got on everything we wanted. The atmosphere was generally charming. Didn't witness as much queue barging as I have done before. Kids loved it all.Bad points:   We were spoken to really rudely by a cast member. Did you know that you can't complain about anything to Disney? They've had so many lawsuits that now they ignore all complaints! Anyway, so I just have to let that one go and not let it spoil the holiday.   expense, with the euro so strong it was even more heavy on our pockets!Eurostar only:  getting from eurostar up to the way out. Our party consisted of me, my sister and my mum plus an 8 year old, 6 year old, 2 year old and 10 week old, so a pushchair, pram and four suitcases to contend with. There was absolutely no help whatsoever in getting off the train and getting up to the concourse., it was a nightmare!!  going through security and getting back down to platform, again a nightmare. There were no luggage trolleys so again we were struggling then we had to get everything through the xray machine, including pushchairs etc. one still had a balloon tied to it! Trying to hold a baby, stop kids run amock and get coats off, remove metal items and find it all the other side was ludicrous.Anyway, nothing you can do about it, just a warning to brace yourselves!!I have given three stars because of the cast member and the fact that no one will listen to you if you just want to say what happened.

405465875,4,2016-7,Canada,"We visited first on New Years Day and had a highly mediocre experience. We came back to see if it would be an improvement, and found things to be a little better. There was way less smoking in the park and lines (employees did something about it this time), the employees were in better moods and were a little more magical. We did manage to get a photo with one character (Jafar), but there were not too many for us to see. Disneyland is magical   and if this is your first trip, you will enjoy the rides and the theming. The park is beautiful, the dragon is awesome, haunted mansion and pirates are well done, and the Space Mountain is outstanding. Fireworks are also amazing. It was hard for me to love it as much as someone else might because it just feels like a let down compared to Disneyland and Disneyworld in North America. Not sure why the Euro edition lacks the same intense level of magic, but it does (for example, in Florida, TONS of people have disney apparel, hats and ears. Lots of pins and button collecting, and general Disney enthusiasm from head to toes. We stood in line and in 80 minutes only passed 3 people wearing Disney ears. People seemed to lack that same over the top Disney exciting that we see here. That being said, I can't imagine any kid not loving it. It's still Disney.

485821453,2,2017-5,India,"To start with, the park was too crowded, mostly with chinese and spanish speakingvisitors. At some places, you could not even walk due to the immense number ofpeople. Many of the rides are also too basic and childish. I know this park ismeant to attract children, but come on, so childish !! I have visited it twice inthe past 17 years, and this visit was probably the last. They even rip you offfor food and beverages. The prices are 3 4 times of what you would get them outside. I think Disney as a group has become too greedy. The 2 parades are mediocre as compared to earlier.",Disneyland_California

451598010,3,2017-1,Philippines,We went to Disney after the holidays and it was packed! Lines were average of 30 60 min wait for rides. Don't get a photopass because photographers are hard to find. Bring strollers or rent them... also download their app to help you.We survived it but dead tired with kids who were 2 and 4 yrs old. Because of the crowd it was not as magical as I thought.

With the nice weather and school holidays it meant everyone poured into Disneyland! The Europeans do not seem to understand the art of queuing!! So much pushing and shoving,especially when there was a Disney character. We loved the evening parade and fireworks but you literally have to find a spot about 7:30 pm and wait until 10:15 pm for the show just to get a good spot!The food outlets were so busy and there were never any seats available. The fads passes were more like first come first serve passes as they constantly ran out. The park opens at 8:00am for Disney hotel residents but only a few rides open,we got to the park at 8:30 and still had to wait 60 mins for the dumbo ride!!!!!!!

The highlight was the light show fireworks but why are they on so late?? Most kids are exhausted by that point, and I spent a very long 20 mins carrying her for the show which she didn't want to miss but equally was wiped out and couldn't even enjoy the show.

Starting from the Entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. Even the MTR Trains and the station is specially designed. In my opinion one should by a Two Day Ticket to explore it well if you have time. Else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. An online Two Day Ticket can save around HKD 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket.  Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover.

When you consider this was the 20th Anniversary you would have expected everything to be working and in good order     wouldn   t you?Disney StudioThe Backlot Tram was out of action for several days.The Toy Soldier Parachutes were out of action for several days and then broke down again.Armageddon was not operational for several days.Elements of other rides were dysfunctional and either closed off or covered.There exists a ban on smoking in public in France which is totally ignored in the Studio.Disneyland ParkMany smaller cafes and restaurants around the park were closed or completely shut. The Carousel was closed for several days.There were several elements of other attractions either broken or not working, e.g. Small World.The shows have been reduced greatly and there are very few left.Likewise, the parades are reduced in number and length.There exists a ban on smoking in public in France which is totally ignored in the Disneyland Park.The moving walkway approaches to the park are either not working at all or only some of the time, with repairs in progress on others, often, the direction you want to travel in is non operational.The pushing in by the local populace is as bad as it ever was; you face strategic blocking in the queues to retain your space.We had one or two heated moments during our visit which you do not experience in the US. The extra    Magic Hours    are a complete waste of time, only one small area is open in Fantasyland and not all the rides were operating! Some of the toilets were disgusting and obviously not cleaned. Food is dearer wherever you go in the park.And FinallyThis will be my last visit to this resort, not because of age, ailment, ability or financial limitation, but because I am sick of the rude, arrogant, pushy, ignorant foreigners that proliferate in this place. Instead I will be going to the US at the earliest opportunity for my next visit where they are more friendly, fun, polite and courteous to each other.I feel the Disney Empire may soon lose the    French connection    and the support of the many influential businesses that put their name to Disneyland Paris e.g. Lever Bros; it   s going down the pan, just like its currency.

Upon arrival at the park we couldn't believe we were there because there was NO welcome. No music, no staff, no ANYTHING   just an ornate entrance with lines inside for tickets. Same thing when passing through onto Main Street   no magic! No greeters, no entertainment. We found the board with listed wait times but no information on fast passes and no staff person to ask.The park itself was clean but the bathrooms were messy. Quick food choices are dismal   Magnum ice cream pops? Quiet walks between attractions, without any street entertainment or cast members to assist guests. You could have been at any amusement park! The shops have a limited selection, especially of adult sized clothing. Dinner at The Blue Lagoon inside the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction was good and the theming very nice.",Disneyland_Paris
185559905,4,2013-11,Canada,"There is something strange about going to Disneyland all bundled up. Mits. Toques. Scarfs. It was 2 degrees in Paris for our Disney visit. Brrrrr.Firstly, I'll say that getting to Disney was a breeze. The RER puts you right on Walt's doorstep. Disneyland, Disney Studios and the Disney Village are right there. Easy mcsqueezy. *tip* The Disney Village is the only place with free wifi. Ok, we hit up Disney Studios first. It's small but fun. A couple of attractions were closed, probably because its winter time. The only ride that required a wait was the Crush's Coaster, since it is so popular and also since it breaks down a lot. It's pretty innovative and worth the wait.I felt that most of the attractions, although enjoyable, were smaller and under themed versions of the American originals. The Tower of Terror seemed like a much shorter drop and the Aerosmith coaster had no narrative. The same can be said about both parks actually. The careful theming that is employed in the US that makes the park so special is somewhat glossed over here and that is on top of the understood degradation that comes with the language translation. Regardless, we had great fun. Zero lines. Some cool new attractions and some old faves.Then we popped over to Disneyland Park. It's beautiful. The entrance gate and Main Street USA is a triumph. Simply majestic with a touch, and I mean a tiny touch of European flair. The castle is pink! Nice! The park is beautiful and the attractions were great. Again, some of the theming was lost, but still fun and unique in their own way. Any rides better than the US you ask? Yes actually. Big Thunder Mountain is bigger, faster and zooms underground to get to the ride on an island! Cool! Space Mountain, Mission 2, was Space tastic! A fresh design and great effects made this ride better than the originals. It's a Small World was modified with Christmas fun and also included a small section for my native Canada, which is not the case for Orlando. Shame on you Orlando!Rides that were unique? The Phantom Manor had its own unique story line that tied into the fact it was situated in Frontierland. Kinda weird, but cool. The Pirates of the Caribbean was not as spooky, but very fun. Lame rides? Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril, was actually periless. Very lame. This could have been an amazing temple of doom style indoor mine chase ride (which is what was originally planned, but they cheaped out). Mystery of the Nautilus.....skip it. And where is the Jungle Cruise? Boo!The park is also littered with cool little attractions like a pirate landing and a Alice in wonderland maze. Simple and fun.Let me say this much. I'm a Disney fan. If you find yourself at a Disney Park every few years like I do, then don't be surprised if you're a touch disappointed with Disneyland Paris. With that said, all in all, my wife and I battled the elements and had a fabulous time. It's an absolute sight and fun for the whole family. A must see if you are in Paris and a must see for Disney junkies like myself! Thanks Walt!",Disneyland_Paris
163252403,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"We have been to the park a few times previously & we noticed how there were no Disneyland staff jotted around the park as before, which was a shame as we had told our grandchildren if they got separated from us to go up to one of the Disney staff. Fortunately all was ok but there was no one to ask directions etc. The wait time for the rides was 30 minutes upwards & I noticed one ride had a wait time of 80 minutes. I waited with my grandchildren for the Peter Pan ride for 45 minutes & the ride lasted 3 minutes! They enjoyed it though. The Buzz Light Year ride broke down a couple of times which was of great disappointment for my 5 yr. old grandson. The Dreams light show at 11pm is amazing but such a long wait to get a decent view. Same with the parade at 7 pm & it only lasted 10   15 minutes. Food & drink is expensive & again the wait time in line is about 25 minutes. Be prepared to be pushed & shoved by rude guests who think they have the right to push their way around the park.",Disneyland_Paris
197328479,5,2014-3,Canada,"You know it's great so I will just give some tips & pointers.Space Mountain, Cars, and the Tower of Terror were the most fun.Get on a ride and if you like it grab a  fast pass  to come back later. You can have 1  fast pass  every 2 hours in EACH park. Work it right and you can avoid long lines like CARS. We waited 2 hours and some people over 3 hours. With a  fast pass  we were on in 10 mins.Everything is expensive so bring a backpack (it will be inspected prior to entry) with water & snacks. Maybe even a rain jacket.The most under rated ride was Star Tours. With out giving up too much it is 3 D and bumps you around alot. It has many different themes so every time can be different. Those with motion sickness may want to skip this ride.After some rides they show your picture...lots of funny expressions.A  magic morning  pass gets you in 1 hour early, use it mid week.",Disneyland_California

I would recommend this park to everyone and anyone, it's fun and I didn't think the gift and food stores were too overpriced (I thought it would be worse).

By afternoon, the park is jammed.Get maxpass  it's worth it!Some rides have single rider options.

We were very excited as we are big Disney fans.This was our first time ever staying at a Disney Resort Hotel  a good experience.We stayed at the Sequioa Lodge which was perfect for us. (Great staff and location!)What was not so good? Simply put, the  Magic  seemed missing. The rides were fantastic (Get Fast Passes when possible), but the pushing and shoving is what got me. Forget about the idea of making a proper line to get an autograph and picture with a character. Parents shove their kids to the front and they follow. (lines for characters in the hotels and for Sully   Buzz DID have proper lines!) Get used to fighting your way through. Smoking   there are  smoking areas , but NO ONE cares. People light up all over the place and no  cast member  ever says anything. The Dollar   Euro exchange rate is not good, so that is why everything was SO expensive in our eyes. All that was done was take the dollar price and put a Euro symbol in front of it, e.g. $14.95 for a Jedi Mickey in Florida cost 14.95 Euros (about $22.00)But again, the  magic  was missing   the pride in keeping things up, the friendly faces   not there.Am I glad we went?

203782061,2,2014-4,United States,"Recently went on a trip to Disneyland in Anaheim with the family.Considering how much we spent on 3 park hopper tickets, you would think the  magical experience they sell everyone would be magical.It was by far not very magical at all.They do charge for parking if you drive. We were there with a 3 day park hopper.We went what we thought was slow period after Easter break. That was not the case. First day we were there, the park was very crowded and filled with locals. The park opened at 8 :00 am. We arrived at 7:15 am. Good thing we did. The crowds and lines of people at the gate were horrible.Secondly, the rat race to get to the rides at park opening was absolutely horrible. People were literally running with their children so they could go to the ride of their choice so they wouldn't have to wait in line    and they also ran to the fast pass machines as well. If i had known this was a marathon I would have packed my running clothes. Fast pass machines ran out of tickets in 20 minutes. THe wait times for standby were absolutely terrible later in the afternoon.The sheer amount of strollers and parents who bring their infants    is just overwhelming. They are parked all over   . very hard to squeeze through strollers with screaming children and crowds.Wait times for the Frozen princesses   if you are looking to do that    have daily wait times of 3 4 hours. In turn you see hundreds of tired, crabby, children waiting for hours. Very poorly run. You would think Disney would plan it out better.We experienced much of the same on the other side at California Adventure    their most popular ride is Radiator Springs Cars ride. We had to run to that ride   .because the daily wait times vary from 1.5  3 hrs. While standing in line the ride did stop    it broke down, they got it up and running, however that pushed the morning wait time to over an hour first thing.Unfortunately if you want a low wait time for this ride, your only choice is stay at a resort property and have a magic morning at California Adventure. Otherwise   . the fast pass for the regular patrons is gone very quickly and standby times are very long. If you are a single ride    waits can be from 45 60 min.On our last day at Disneyland we had a magic morning. It was probably the worst of the 3 days. The crowds were huge, the rat race started all over again. People running etc. Only half the park was opening for magic morning. Adventureland and Frontierland was closed. You pay all money for tickets and you have a magic morning   . how about opening the whole park!!! By closing off the 2 areas   . it got even more crowded    and there were more races. Adventureland had most of their rides close for refurbishment   . and the main attraction splash mountain was closed indefinitely due to the weather. The Big thunder railroad was also closed in Frontierland because of mechanical issues.My children left disappointed that some of their favorite rides were closed.THe park food was not healthy, standard amusement park food. Overpriced.Overall our Disney experience was a overpriced, rat race mess. To charge that much money for tickets and to have to run to rides    was not my cup of tea.Needless to say kids got to see Disney and they have no desire to go back .Disappointing experience   .

363570364,5,2016-4,United Kingdom,"We decided to take our 2 daughters and our 3 grandchildren to EuroDisney in Paris as a special treat. We travelled down by car taking Le Shuttle to Calais and driving to the park. Everything was very smooth except as you reach Marne La Vallee the signposts tend to disappear   fortunately we did find the park quite easily but French directional aids are sadly lacking   as are some street signs.We arrived on Wednesday just after lunch and were to depart on Sunday just after breakfast.Check in at the New York Hotel was quiet but unfortunately the Receptionist was really not very nice   not quite rude   but close. However, I should point out that all other staff throughout our stay at the hotel and in the Disney parks were really lovely   very helpful and polite.We had two connecting rooms which was perfect for our party as the children could go back and forth between the two rooms. The rooms were quite roomy and clean and comfortable. The TV was a waste of time   we had hoped there would be access to movies etc., but no. Furthermore there was not information in the room other than room service menu.I was expecting food to be OK but was more than pleasantly surprised   there was a huge choice of venues (we had opted for the half board plus option). We dined at three different venues   in each there was a good choice of food, well cooked and plenty of it. It is necessary to book restaurants before arrival as choice is somewhat limited. You have to consider the age of the children and what you want to visit   for example if you want to watch the parade (from 5.30   6.30) then you need to book a table for around 7.00 which makes it a bit late for little ones. Also, if you are late I don't think they will hold your table for very long. The problem with booking restaurants before you go is that you have not seen them so do not know what to chose. Also, it was pouring with rain   so we wanted to eat in the hotel so that we didn't have to go out again. Anyway...You can opt for breakfast with the characters as an extra charge, but we opted to go to dinner at Chez Mickey and the characters visited each table at no extra cost. The children (and the adults) were enchanted   well worth doing.The parks themselves were great and the 'magic hours' were well worth staying at the hotel for as once the park opens to the general public it is much, much busier.It is difficult knowing what to see and what to do. They do have printed material but there is so much information on it that it is difficult to sort out the shows etc. More work needed.One downside   it was difficult to get a brochure (despite contacting Euro Disney) and in the end I booked via a travel agent and their help was invaluable. They pointed out various things that helped us to book. Getting around the park is a bit tricky for Grandma's as it is quite large, and quite busy. Trying to understand about the transfer buses etc. was difficult   there did not seem to be anywhere or anybody who could say 'the best way to get to the park is by ......   everybody seemed to say 'it is only five or ten minutes walk' In the pouring rain, with mobility problems that was not an option. Would I recommend it   I certainly would.

One hour later we finally got on the ride, which lasted exactly 1min 20 seconds!Some more rides might be a good idea   there are more shops than there are rides.Very little indoor seating at any of the fast food restaurants   fine in summer but not very comfortable on a cold February day. Staff are unfriendly to the point of being rude. Instructions are barked at you. On more than one of the rides, a member of staff came along and tugged at our seatbelt without saying a word, no  excuse me  or  please may I check you have your seatbelt on . As if we were animals being herded. I didn't see a single member of staff smile the entire day and noticed very few smiles on the faces of the other visitors.Nothing magical about it at all.

530935927,5,2017-9,United States,"I hadn't been to Disneyland in many years, but on this revisit I would still agree with my past assessment my heart still loves this place much more than Walt Disney World! Disneyland is less crowded (though yes, the park can get a ton of people on any given day it's still way less crowded than WDW), the weather is generally better at Disneyland, the food is better, and the rides are much closer together (I hate having to go to 4 different parks at WDW to experience the rides I love in just 1 park at Disneyland Resort). The cast members also make this place a winner. I spoke with many different Disneyland employees while trying pin trading for the first time and they were all lovely. Pin trading is a lot of fun too but I will let you know that pin trading has decreased a lot in the parks from what I understand it used to be like in years past. Most of the pin trading has been relegated to a single pin board in each of the shops (or at least a lot of the shops)...you may find a pin cart with a pin board available to perused or a random cast member wearing a lanyard, but don't expect to see pin trading all over the park anymore.Most of the food locations in the park are very good. I ate at the Blue Bayou and at the Carthay Circle...but found my favorite places were actually lower priced locations. I suggest you stick to Rancho del Zocalo and The Red Rose Tavern they were my absolute favorites! At Rancho del Zocalo I would highly recommend the taco salad and at The Red Rose Tavern any sandwich with a side of the pommes frites those things are AMAZING! Those meals with a large drink will run you around $17 $20. Oh, and at Rancho del Zocalo you can get free soda refills!!!!! Both places have great portions and a much better price margin than most anything else in the park.As for the rides, they are all just as good as I remember them to be. Fun, light hearted, and thoroughly enjoyable. At Disneyland you are just a hop, skip, and a jump away from the next ride too...so much better than WDW, lol. You can go from ride to ride and have a fun filled day of dozens and dozens of different rides ridden. And on rare occasions you might even be invited to do something cool, like I was fortunate enough to get to do on one night of my trip. My dad and I were riding on the monorail late one evening and the conductor Sam asked us if we would like to ride in the front of the monorail with her while she drove. We not only got to ride in the front but she also let us take pictures in the driver's seat once we were back at the station! And it's things like this that keep Disneyland as the clear winner of my heart over Walt Disney World any day!",Disneyland_California

Parking also cost $17.A lot of the rides were stopped for half hour periods & kept breaking down presumably down to such high temperatures. We queued for over half an hour for the haunted house to get to the front & be told there were technical difficulties & to come back later   felt we wasted a lot of time & didn't get much back. As so many rides were down the ones that were running had large wait times. The park also closed earlier @ 8 on the day we went due to the halloween special. Having been to the one in Florida i felt that is better which combined with the lack of working rides probably spoilt the experience for me. ,Disneyland_California

Character meet & greet seemed to be cut short sometimes again I think because of the heat. Bought the photopass  then was hugely disappointed to find that any characters we did queue up for didn't have a photographer with them! what is the point of the photopass then? got a photo from Buzz Lightyear and Pirates of the Caribbean but nothing else we took the kids on had pictures to add on. queued for Baloo and king Louis with no picture taken! Breakfast at caf   mickey with no photographer. Lunch with Disney pricesses with no photographer   come on Paris, catch up with your American counterparts here. not even photographers walking the parks taking lovely snaps at the castle or on main street as they do in the states. it didn't ruin our break but unless you are going on the big rides, not sure photopass is worth it.",Disneyland_Paris

The only ride we waited longer then 15 minutes for was the Finding Nemo submarine ride (which was new), otherwise we almost walked right on to every ride. 2) Bob Sehlinger's book  The Unofficial Guide to Disneyland . Even though I had been to Disneyland a half dozen times before (but not since DCA had opened) this book gave me a  plan of attack  months before our visit. The touring plans in the back are awesome.

It is aggravating to know that you paid about the same price for a three day pass as the locals paid for a one year pass. Disney needs to increase the annual pass cost to decrease crowd sizes by about 30%. It's just not fair, and it's just not fun with that many people.

5017720,5,missing,Austria,"I want to share my experiences with all other parents who are planing to go to Disneyland Paris (DLP) with their children. I just returned from a 8 day trip with my 8 year old boy (15 22. April) of which 2 days were spent in DLP. After extensive research on the net about how to experience DLP in the most efficient and enjoyable way I would like to give you a summary of the most valuable tips:As for a trip to Paris in general I have come to the conclusion that don  t bother going with small children (0 6 yrs). It will be tiering, expensive and wont yet leave a lasting impression on them! Disneyland Paris is probably not yet worth the money at this age. Whatever your kids will enjoy doing in DLP you can offer them for a fraction of the price in your home town! So, wait until they are a bit older to really enjoy the experience. Our friends with 3 kids (8,6,4) had a 1 day horror experience. The 8 year old enjoyed herself, the 6 year old was sleeping in the 4 year olds buggy while the 4 year old had one fit after the other. When the DLP closed even the parents picked a fight. Arrive EARLY before opening time. Although the opening was scheduled at 10 am, they let you through to Main Street USA at 9.30 am: entry to the lands at 10 am sharp.  If you arrive with luggage do not waist time checking into your hotel. You can store your stuff at the entrance to the complex for     2,5.  for the day  buy your entrance ticktes, take a map of DLP and enter the Park on foot     do not take the train     it is awfuly slow!!!!!!  get fast pass tickets for all the main rides (6) see list below: don  t start going for apparently 5 min rides     fastpasses will be out by 11.00 !!!! This means you will spend half a day getting your fastpasses and running through all the lands and then going on your fastpass rides. List of Fastpass attractions:Frontierland1.Big Thunder Mountain (mild roller coaster   great fun)Fantasyland2.Peter Pan's Flight (quite boring)Discoveryland3.Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast (my 8 year old liked it)4.Star Tours (good)5.Space Mountain: Mission 2 132 cm (didn  t do)Adventureland6. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril 140 cm (didn  t do)   If you particularly enjoy any of the fastpass attraction get another fastpass ticket as soon as you come out of that attraction.    perhaps fastpasses will stil be available for a second ride in the afternoon! Using this method we went on Buzz Lightyear twice.  If you want to watch the The Lion King show without queuing go to the Hyperion Caf   at the Videopolis Theatre (in Discoveryland) and buy yourself a meal half an hour before the show starts. The show is in the same building! Get your food, get a seat and watch the show while you eat!!!! People who didn  t know about that were queuing for the show for hours!  At 16.00 the parade begins, so time your rides to ensure that you are already waiting on the edge of the parade route 30 45 minutes before it starts. Pick a good spot near the start of the parade route The parade enters the Parade Route from next to  it's a small world . A good spot is opposite the Pizzeria Bella Notte or gelateria Fatansia. Usually far less crowded than the rest of the route. Remembered to sit down near the barrier early this time to get good view.  If you watch where the parade starts you can then head back to the rides while everyone else is still watching. Tried this trick on two consecutive days and was able to go on 4 almost empty rides until the masses came back from watching the parade.   Get on your last rides just before the park closes  You will be in the park after everyone else has left, and all the shops on Main Street are still open. (this way we went on thounder mountain 4 times!!!!)  We stayed at the M  wenpick (a 4 Star much cheaper non Disney hotel), which can be reached easily by the purple PEP BUSES. Why pay more for a 2 star Disney hotel? You only go there to sleep anyway.  Take sandwiches from your hotel breakfast buffet for a snack in the park..  Carry a zipable bag and a bottle of water around.   Keep valuables on you. Not in your bag!  There is no pharamacy around.  Both shows Lion King and The Tarzan show are to be recommended  Buffallo Bill Dinner Show at night has to be purchased separetly   can be recommended.What would I do differently?  I would try and book a breakfast with the disney characters on the day of my arrival at DLP for 8 to 9 am. This way the kids get their autograph for sure. It means no queuing to see them in the park and the possibility to walk around the park before masses arrive.  Take more time to enjoy the Disneyland illusion (I know it  s hard to enjoy while running after fastpass tickets, trying to orient yourself in this huge complex)What did my 8 year old enjoy most1.Big Thunder Mountain (mild roller coaster   great fun) in Frontierland fastpass2.Pirates of the carabean Adventureland no fastpass (best time to do right after you have watched the parade at the beginin of the parade route, whlie others are stil watching it)3.Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast and Star Tours in Discoveryland fastpass4.In Fantasyland he enjoyed it  a s small world. He didn  t enjoy Peter Pan's Flight (fastpass) that much and I agree (quite boring).5.Buffallo Bill Dinner Show. It was a wonderfull way to end the Disney experience.So, plan ahead, be well prepared and equiped and most of all enjoy the experience yourself.

188149646,4,2013-12,United States,"Disney still is right at the top of the heap of theme parks in the U.S. and deservedly so. Our 3 and 5 year old grandaughters and their parents enjoyed a wonderful, if exhausting, three days before Christmas this year. Nothing I say here is intended to discourage anyone from visiting Disneyland, but knowing what is in store might allow better preparations.Disneyland has never been inexpensive, I guess, but get ready to lay out some serious cash for everything from food to souvenirs to special attractions. We spent about $40.00 on a pair of autograph books and pens, for example.Although early December is somewhat crowded, it's not as packed as other times at this venue. Nonetheless, some of the waiting time for rides was just off the chart, particularly because many rides were closed, concentrating the visitors into the remaining open rides. The Tower of Terror had a double wait, one before entering the ride, then another wait to finally enter the elevator. Another type of wait is less obvious, the wait to get OFF a ride once the action has concluded. We had not noticed this problem in our previous trips to Disneyland at all. At first this appears to be the result of too many cars, gondolas, submarines, flying ships, etc., on the ride in the first place. But upon further analysis, this may be that the workers simply are not working at the proper pace to load and unload riders as quickly as the designers intended. The wait to get OFF the submarine ride  in the dark  seemed almost as long as the wait to get on. The Pirates ride, It's a Small World, the Hounted House and more had similar problems. Is this a result of the poor work ethic of the young workers or some larger issue with the way these rides are now configured?Even the food venues often had lines out the door. I was asked to wait on an ordinary coffee mocha for 10 15 minutes after I had made my way to the front of the long waiting line. Overall we had a wonderful time, but I think the polish is not quite what it once was at this legendary theme park.",Disneyland_California
199719469,5,2013-10,United States,"This was my first visit to Disneyland. I grew up in Florida, and know Disney World like the back of my hand, so it was fascinating to finally go to Disneyland. The two places are very different, but of course a bit the same. Its like two great artists painting the same thing. The main differences are in the size and  feel . Disneyland is much smaller and only two parks (Im counting California Adventure in this review, as to aid in the comparison). Disney World is four parks (not counting the water parks and other attractions). Disney World also is more of a self contained resort, with a ton of Disney owned hotels. Disneyland feels a bit more like a traditional theme park. The positives of this is that Disneyland, being much smaller, is much easier on the feet and easier to get around in. Its not as jaw dropping in terms of spectacle as Disney World (with maybe the exception of Cars Land at California Adventure, which they did a smashing job on recreating Radiator Springs), but most of the attractions are the same, and some, such as Space Mountain, are much better at Disneyland than Disney World. Cars Land makes California Adventure a must see, and if your kids like the Cars movies as much as mine, it is really awesome. One positive of Disney Land is that its much easier to do a non Disney hotel. In Disney World, I almost always go for an on site Disney Hotel   its part of the experience. At Disneyland, its not essential. Also, the meal plan at Disney World is a serious consideration. At Disneyland, with all the restaurants around, its not needed.A few other things we noted. First, while the cast members at both parks are great, the characters at Disney Land were much more interactive and spent more time with the kids. The climate in California is much more comfortable than Florida. You may need a light jacket in the morning, but it was nice not sweating to death in the high temperatures and humidity of Orlando. One negative is getting from the airport to the parks. LAX is not fun, and the lines are so long. Give yourself plenty of time to arrive early. Took us over an hour to get through security. LAX is about an hour away. I know that there are other airports that are closer. Transport is not as nice, quick and easy as the Disney Shuttle service is from MCO to Disney World.Not a negative, but just a note   the vast majority of fellow visitors to the park are from the LA area and the west coast. I think most people in the rest of the US go to Disney World. I think they are missing something. Its a different experience   smaller, more intimate, more compact, but still with that Disney quality. I don't think either Disney World or Disneyland is better or worse than the other   just different....and that difference is good. Which I would choose would depend on my mood and my budget. If I want total Disney resort immersion where I can totally forget the rest of the world exists for my entire vacation time, including hotel and dining, and I want big spectacle, and I have a nice budget and an entire week off (so I could hit all the parks), I would lean towards Disney World. If I wanted a Disney experience in a more easy to consume size, had a small budget and or less time off, and maybe still want to keep one foot back in  the real world , then Disneyland is the choice.",Disneyland_California

There are lots of mature trees, beautiful flowers, and some beautiful water features.Disneyland Park Paris is a place where people of all ages, can truly have fun TOGETHER.

It has a single rider line, which involves two elevator rides, I kid you not. I almost got lost in there. I saw Tangled and Beauty and the Beast, which I both liked. And I saw a nice song and dance show at Fantasyland Theatre. And the Nemo submarine ride was good.If you have a Magic Morning entry you might want to use it for Peter Pan ride as that queue builds up fast.

82047023,2,missing,United Kingdom,"3rd visit to the park, first visit stayed in Sequoia Lodge, second Newport Bay, this time New York. If there was to be a fourth time, and there won't then it would be back to Newport Bay. I'll cover the hotel issues in another post.The park! Well it's Disney so the usual impressive Disney infrastructure always in evidence. We had a really heavy rainstorm on one morning and within minutes of the rain ending and the sun coming out there were people out sweeping the puddles away. The attention to detail always impresses, as does the general cleanliness of the place.However my main complaint is down to the number of attractions which were either closed, some for refurbishment others just closed, and others which just kept breaking down so you'd be turfed out after having queued. Too many to mention frankly.Now couple this with the balance seeming to have shifted unfavourably between the entertainment side and the retail  try and extract every last euro out of the visitor side  and then add in a healthy, or maybe should that be unhealthy dose of exchange rate misery, and it starts to leave a bit of a bad taste.Which nicely turns us to the food. Now Disney has never been particularly noted for fine dining, though Walt's always was, and indeed still is, the exception here. We had a first rate Sunday lunch on the half board plus menu and even the picky eaters in the family tried and supremely enjoyed everything, even things they thought they might not like. However away from Walt's, oh dear oh dear. You expect junk food, Casey's Corner is hot dogs for heaven's sake so nothing fancy. But soggy wet buns wrapped round ultra cheap dogs? Come on for that price I'd expect fine dogs not the rubbish that was served up on our visit, and way below what was served on previous stays.And so it went on, some places on the HB  list trying to be too fancy and just failing way way short. Others who have no pretensions to be fancy just being grim, eg Punta del Oro Tex Mex, found ouselves sticking to the floors and to the tables. YUK!Beaver Creek Tavern, fatty lamb, cold vegetables, dry and cold swordfish steak, desserts were good though.Parkside Diner, inedible main courses on the buffet, many adults were resorting to the childrens menu.Annettes Diner, another bright star and all three of us fully enjoyed our meal, they have been alongside Walt's as one of the more reliable places over the years.And then you try to go to places that you've visited before, eg Cowboy Cook out barbecue... closed, La Grange at Billy Bob's.... closed and so it went on. Les Cascadeurs... closed.Having paid for Half Board plus we were struggling to find suitable places to eat. We've found on previous visits that the best way to approach the parks is to take a sit down table service lunch early afternoon, that gives you a rest, and sets you up for the rest of the day. With what was on offer, assuming they were actually open, then this strategy was, for us a non starter.Of course it's not all a negative review, and some of the cast really do work hard to make people's visit enjoyable, but it seemed that they were struggling against a huge penny pinching strategy. For example first time ever with a long wait for It's a Small World. Why? Because only reduced number of staff on, and so those who were working refused to load every boat and were only loading alternate boats. I can however understand the logic why they were doing this, but it probably needed just one more cast member on duty. Yet the shops were packed with staff, extracting your money you see?So I'm sorry Disney Corporation, you charge a not inconsiderable sum for a visit, you've tipped over the edge from providing an attraction and turned it into a huge cash extraction process. Truth be known it was always that, but it is now just so blatant.I cannot recommend this venue until things change.I post very few reviews on here mainly due to time and only if I feel I have something to say, very often what I would say has already been said by others, so why take yp TS bandwidth.But DP needs a stinker of a review to get the act together.",Disneyland_Paris

Friday afternoon was OK, we didn't wait too long for most of the rides, and the bulk were operating.Saturday and Sunday was a disaster though. We stayed in one of the Disney hotels, so we could enter the park earlier. Supposed  magic hours , so not worth it !!!Most of the rides weren't functioning, sort of defeats the whole purpose, was even worse on the Sunday.Quite often we would wait and the ride would then just close, obviously some safety issue.

262517409,3,2015-3,United Kingdom,"We have just spent 1 day in disneyland park, Paris. We are a family of 2 adults, a 9 year od girl and a 7 year old girl. We stayed in Paris and got the the train out to Disney which is very simple on the rer a line. Takes roughly 30 40 mins depending on where you get on in Paris.Once there my first issue was that as it was a weekend day I thought I had to buy a m  gic ticket rather than a mini ticket. I then thought Iwas entitled to extended opening hours but I was sadly wrong. I couldn't get in until 9.30 and even if you go in then you can't actually access the rides until 10 unless you are staying in a Disney hotel or have an annual pass so word of warning make sure you know what time you can get in fromAfter 10am things improved. The weather was a little rainy and generally we went on most rides if a max of 30mins queue on big thunder mountain but everything else generally less than 15mins. I was pleasantly s  rprised expecting queues to bores. The fast pass system for tickets is recommended. Try to use it if you can. We h  d snacks in our rucksack but had lunch in a Mexican place, Fuentes orca which was pretty good food. 12 euro per adult and less per ki including puddingand a drink.Better quality food than you'd get in an English theme park I think.All in all an enjoyable day but not amazing. I think the Age of your child hugely influen  es things. My girls aren't nt   princesses and not bothered about meeting them and getting autographs soi can't comment on the process of doing that. I can't say the rides are very exciting for older kids. 5 rides were closed on he day we visited and so the only roller coasters were thundr montain and Indiana jones. Neither particularly scary or Long.We did enjoy our day but think we were lucky with queues.

3395286,5,missing,United States,"I'm 25 years old and this July I'll be taking my eleventh trip to Disneyland. I can honestly say it's the BEST place to go for fun. Although I have to say I don't suggest going there over the Christmas holiday. I did just this past year in 2004. It's the most crowded time of the year. I had gone the previous summer and it wasn't nearly as crowded that time. The majority of the visitors during the holiday season are sick and coughing in everyones face. I'd have to say the best time to go is the summer on a week day. If you go during the least crowded time of the year, usually in October, that's when the Matterhorn is shut down for refurbishment.

The grizzly bear ride is something I did three times and it was fun (single rider saves time..opt for that to beat queues) Toystory land, mystic house, space adventure zone etc are not to be missed. There were some good shows like lion king, golden mickeys where we could see all the characters together. take the tickets and information pamphlets in advance to save time.

362994744,1,2016-4,United Kingdom,"I am writing this with a heavy heart having visited this attraction practically every year at Easter for the past 10 years. In fact, we were so disappointed by our experience this time that we probably won't be going back. WHY?With three kids, all under the age of 12, we go there for the rides. However, the following were all closed last week:Practically everything at FRONTIERLAND including:1. Big Thunder Mountain (Fastpass)2. Phantom Manor3. Thunder Mesa Riverboat Landing4. Pocahontas Indian VillageMost of ADVENTURELAND including:5. La Cabane des Robinson6. Pirates' Beach7. Adventure IsleAt FANTASYLAND:8. Peter Pan's Flight (Fastpass)And at DISCOVERYLAND:9. Star Wars (Fastpass)So of the 6 feature attractions (Fastpass), HALF OF THEM WERE CLOSED. And the total (9) equates to about a third of the park!And to compound this, with tickets for access to both parks, the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster (Faspass) at Walt Disney Studios were closed too! They do publish attractions that are closed on their website so CHECK FIRST BEFORE BOOKING YOUR HOLIDAYS! We always go at Easter to avoid the busy summer queues, which we find unbearable. This Easter was unusually quiet   I guess in part due to the closure of so many rides and additionally the recent atrocities in France and Belgium. However, despite this, those who were there were queuing for less rides open, so queues were as long as they usually are.We managed to get on to about 10 rides each in a day. At   270 in entry fees (1 day, 2 parks) for the 5 of us (2 adults, 3 children), that's   27 per ride. Good value for money? Not when you consider that among these 10 were things like the Carrousel and Tea Cups, you might want to consider visiting your local fun fair or UK theme parks. Especially when you add your transport, hotel and food expenses, it presents the prospect of going to Disneyland Paris in a very negative light.We had a VIP Fastpass from a previous visit which they issue to guests that stay in their swanky suites, thinking that we could use it this time. However, they no longer issue or honor these, so it seems that there is very little incentive to spend any money with them on accommodation either. Fortunately, we stayed at a better hotel (and there are plenty nearby) off site for far less!And when I'd asked their representatives at the information centre (City Hall) as to why there were so many closures, they were well rehearsed in objection handling stating text book responses that they are getting ready for the summer and their 25th anniversary, that rides were getting tired and that closures were published on their website etc ... So what about us then? In light of these closures, why were we charged MAGIC rates (which is not the cheapest tariff)? It seems that Disneyland are still hell bent on cashing in on the hard earned cash of working families who can only travel during school holidays! I hope that in writing this long (and perhaps rambling) review that some of you may think twice as to whether you want to visit, and if you do when you plan to visit the theme park.If you still do, a few tips:1. Save yourself some money and stay at at a hotel or serviced apartment off site. You can always prepare a picnic and return back to the car park (where there is a picnic area nearby) for lunch   dinner.2. Plan ahead by checking their website for closures and devise an itinerary accordingly. Otherwise, you'll end up walking around aimlessly and queuing unnecessarily (as we did this time). 3. Get yourself a Fastpass as early as possible to cut down your queuing time later. You can only secure one Fastpass at any one time (this was not the case before) but if you get an early return time, you may be able to get another for a different attraction before they are fully allocated for the day. The newer attractions like Ratatouille are always very popular.4. Make sure you don't miss the Parade (5.30 pm last week) and stick around for the light show   firework display when the park closes (10 pm).",Disneyland_Paris
242020688,5,2014-11,United Kingdom,"Have been visiting disneyland Paris every year since 2002, and thoroughly enjoyed every trip. I was a little disappointed with this years Christmas events as it seems down scaled compared to previous years. However the park itself is just as magical anytime of the year. We stayed at a disney hotel so took advantage of the magic hours which meant we could access the park 2 hours before park opened to the general public. we went during the week, term time so had minimal queuing time, which meant we got to experience all the rides and attractions that we wanted to see. I would recommend finding a spot for disney dreams show approx 45 mins before it starts to get a good view of the show, as it gets very busy. Also get a spot for the parade approx 30mins before start..I reccommend the seating area opposite the stage by the annual pass office as you get the backdrop of the castle in your pics, have a seat, and theres nowhere to stand opposite so all the characters will come to see you as they go past, good for the little ones. Make the most of the fast pass for Peter pan and thunder mountain as these are the rides that tend to get the biggest queues.

Not much to do there. Disney also had its problems. Indiana closed, train closed, Space down many times, got stuck on it once. Thunder, Matterhorn and Star Tours all down at times, Pirates had the longest line I have ever seen and a boat got stuck in it. All the rest had two hour waits lines or more. We paid 488.00 two day pass to get in, a big price in my book for all the closures and down times. Not one reservation for dinner to be had in either park either day. Seems something must change...limit the number of people, some come so far and not be able to experience all is a big let down.

We went on a Monday and there was practically no line in most of the rides (including the popular ones). It was just too humid that day and we were thankful that we came in wearing comfortable clothing.Since there were no lines, we were able to go through some rides twice   most of the time to cool down since it was just too hot outside. It was unfortunate that there were rides that were closed for maintenance such us the Buzz Lightyear ride but we were informed via email prior to the visit.Disneyland is always a great way to spend time with family. It creates memories that kids will remember and may even pass on to their kids. I'm happy Hong Kong is just an hour flight away.Living in an Asian country, as well, I have gotten used to the unpredictable weather change. So, I suggest to bring a light jacket (for the kids) as some rides may tend to be cold and an umbrella   either for the rain or for shade   useful either way. You may also want to explore the park for food options as there is a variety of cuisines available.

Others like 'It's a Small World' were closed when we arrived but reopened the day we left (to my daughter's delight!).If you have daughters that love the Disney Princesses, and you don't mind spending extra, do the Princess lunch at the Auberge de Cendrillon. It's worth every single penny for the experience of getting up close and chatting with at least 3 princesses and some associated characters (the mice from Cinderella, the fairy godmothers from Sleeping Beauty for example).Final point   if you are staying in one of the hotels don't just join the normal queue to get in, look around the side entrances for queues just for hotel guests.",Disneyland_Paris
482109169,5,2017-5,United States,"We were able to take advantage of the $150 local resident three day pass, and used two half days at Disneyland. Five hours was just about enough. The first day started in the morning and took advantage getting into the park an hour early ,although you are only permitted to visit Tomorrowland, and Fantasyland until 9:00.",Disneyland_California
156480999,4,2013-3,United States,"Get to the park early and get your Fast Passes!! I can not stress this enough. One of the fastest ones to go are for Radiator Springs Racers. With in an hour of the park opening the passes were gone for the day. Without a Fast pass the wait time was three hours everyday. Another thing worth getting a fast pass for is the colored light show put on every night. Simply amazing! If you are going to Disney you have probably researched and studied everything about the park so you should know what to expect. Yes everything is expensive and yes the lines are long but just go there and enjoy the sights and sounds and memories you will take home of the joy in your kids, grand kids or significant others eyes. Worth every dollar. ",Disneyland_California
432818686,5,2016-10,Australia,By far the original is still the best is the world. However the fireworks are really disappointing people start jockeying for prime spots hours before the event only for it to over in five minutes. One night we were there the Angels had a home game with a fireworks display that last at least another five minutes longer. The staff are fantastic but there was one stand out cast member   Max. Max was marvelous we were traveling with a child in a wheelchair and Max went out of the way to ensure he had a day to remember. Thank you Max you were amazing   Elvis sends he love,Disneyland_California
238688614,5,2014-9,United States,"Be sure to use the fast pass system. Used to be that you could find a time of year when the park was less crowded, but that is no longer the case, though weekends, summer and holidays it is always more so. Must see attractions: DCA: Radiator Springs Racers & Soarin' over California, World of Color show, eat appetizers at the Carthay Circle bar. Disneyland: Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Matterhorn, Big Thunder, Space Mountain, Fireworks show & eating at the Blue Bayou. Make food reservations early by calling Disney Dining (at least a month in advance for any upper class restaurants like the Blue Bayou). Plaza Inn is nice buffet service, Rancho Del Zocalo is good Mexican in Frontierland, love the French onion soup at caf   Orleans and any skewers are good at the Bengal Barbeque. Downtown World of Disney store is best for shopping as they have most of what is found in both parks, but not all  you kind of have to look around in different lands shops if you really want to see everything that is available. Cast members have changed over the years  they are generally less accommodating enthusiastic these days, more like what you find out in the normal work force than the 'special' Disney service attitude. But the Disney attractions are still up there as far as the best amusement park in the world! Hope it keeps going strong for another 50 years!",Disneyland_California
431535130,4,2016-10,United Kingdom,"Went for a three night, four day stay with our 6 year old daughter. For organisation, keeping people moving and reasonably happy with long queues Disney can't be matched. Frontierland was pretty much boarded up as work was going on on Thunder Mountain and the paddle boat so that really didn't leave much to go on there. Discoveryland also had boards up but not to as great an extent. From my last visit the meeting of characters had stopped being a free for all and people now queued which is so much better, though in fact my daughter wasn't interested in meeting any character much to my disappointment. I have in the past found the staff to be surly but I cannot fault them this time from the cleaners, the ride operators and the shop assistants, they were all friendly and helpful. The toilets could have been cleaner but I think it was more from some of the disgusting guests rather than lack of effort by staff. As an adult you know that you are being given the hard sell and paying over the odds for snacks and meals but actually I had so much fun that I didn't care.",Disneyland_Paris
327185980,5,2015-11,United States,I decided to spend my last full day at Disneyland.  They happened to be celebrating the 10th Anniversary of Hong Kong Disneyland.  The experience was great considering I never had the opportunity to visit any Disney park as a child.  I would definitely visit again.,Disneyland_HongKong
627035813,4,2018-10,Canada,"We had our first real family vacation in Disneyland and it was amazing! Things to expect:  Long entrance lines. Some people find this frustrating but the lines do move fairly quickly and they are checking everyone for your own safety. We recommend hats, sunscreen, and water bottles during your time both in line and in the park.  They don't allow selfie sticks! We lost $20CND because we had to surrender ours. They did allow go pro sticks though which didn't seem fair considering they are virtually the same thing! Long ride lines. Get the Max pass on your phone for fast passes! It makes all the difference for those rides in high demand! You can be in line for over an hour during peak times. Also find out which are the rides you want to hit that are most in demand and secure a fast pass for your magic morning if you get one with your park pass or hotel stay. Saves you time for sure! Crowds. It sort of goes without saying but Disney sees over 50,000 visitors per day! Considering the amount of people you can move freely through the park and it's incredibly clean! It's the lines when you notice it the most, or during special events. Catching characters for pictures throughout the park is quite hit and miss. Even knowing where they tend to appear isn't going to guarantee you find them or that you are in line during their 15 minute window. If you are trying to catch rides you don't have a lot of time to chase down Alice or Mickey for pics unless you are around the park for over a week and can take your time. You will find some of course, but getting all your favourites takes time and a bit of stalking LOL! Get tickets for shows like Fantasmic first thing in the morning! They sell out fast. Come evening get in place to watch about 45 minutes early otherwise you will be standing throughout after a long day of walking the park! If you have food allergies, speak to the park BEFORE your trip! It will save you a ton of time if you know where you can eat and where it is in advance. You can then plan your travel through the park allowing yourself to be near to your favourite food venue during lunch etc. You can find food on the run, but it does take time and searching, which you don't want to waste when your time in the park is limited.  If you have never been to a Disney park it is unlike any other theme park experience! It truly is magical! I wasn't sold before we went, but it really is amazing, crowds and lines aside!Things to note before you book: Check for special event hours. As we are not locals and have never been to Disney our vacation time was cut drastically short due to the fact no one told us about the reduced park hours. We assumed the Halloween or Christmas stuff was part of the general park experience and had no idea we would lose half our days to people coming in for a party that we could not attend. It really took away from our experience and caused us to miss out on things (after awaiting this special trip for years!) It was the biggest disappointment we experienced. I cannot emphasize enough how much this impacted our holiday. Consider the weather during your travel time. We are Canadian and not accustomed to extreme heat so going in October was perfect! We had beautiful sunny skies, but we were also able to enjoy the park without running for air conditioning every ten minutes. The locals told us that the summer months are far more extreme, so if you are unacustomed to heat plan to go during their fall season to have the best weather experience. The experience is expensive! If you intend to purchase a lot of souveniers, take part in pin trading (look it up,it's so much fun!), or eat in park be prepared to spend. The pins for pin trading range from $9.99 for singles to upwards of $27.00USD for packs. Soda pop or water is about $3.00USD each at the vendors so that gives you an idea of what the food prices are like. The food is great in some areas, not so fantastic in others but it is all costly. Read reviews and blogs to learn about rides, food, tickets, helpful tips, and more! The more you know planning your trip and entering the park the better your experience will be! There is so much to see and do that you want to ensure you don't miss something because you simply didn't know about it. They have stroller parking at most rides and you can get a parent swap pass if one parent needs to stay with the littles while the older children go on with the other parent. It allows the waiting parent to fast track the line up if they wish to try the ride when they return! Everyone can experience the magic of Disney! Don't be discouraged if you get motion sick. Unfortunately I can't stomach anything but the ride through story rides, but I had an amazing time anyway! The sights are wonderful and the people are great!We had such a good time, I just wish we had gotten our full days so we could have our full experience. Our disappointment at the reduced hours (and letting the special event ticket holders flood into the park a half hour before the event) was the only thing holding us back from a full five star rating! We will return again one day as Disneyland has a special place in our hearts!",Disneyland_California
264996033,3,2015-3,United Kingdom,"We visited in late March when there seemed to quite a bit of refurbishment going on. The castle had work doing to it which was really disappointing as that's kind of what you go to Disney to see   plus there were a few rides out including the main roller coaster. It was a shame that considering the quite expensive cost of the ticket, we weren't given any compensation for this.Nevertheless, there was still lots to see and do in the park. Particularly enjoyed the Space Mountain ride and Toy Story section. The parade was decent and just generally strolling around the park is really nice. Funnily enough the train that you get to the park is also a highlight   Mickey Mouse shaped windows and handles on the hand rails   a great way to start the trip!We were four friends around 24 25 years old and while we went to Disney for a bit of nostalgia, we did kind of crave a bit more of the thrill seeking part   and I think others that are looking for this too will be better heading over to Ocean Park, which I wish we did!",Disneyland_HongKong

570347223,4,2018-3,United Kingdom,I had brought a 2 day ticket to use on both disneyland park and walt studio. It is really fun time for kids.. There were people from all over the world.friendly staff. They were queues so do have that in mind but we did go in a school holiday period. They have pushchair rentals.. if its rains the sell raincoats. There is a currency exchange in the disneyland park at the beginning you can use your cards also. Lots of walking to do.. lovely parade everyday at 5pm. Would recommend the disneyland park for younger kids aged 5 to 13 and walt studio side to the elder kids. First day explored the disneyland park which we did cover and the 2 nd day what was left 2 3 rides to cover we did and then went to the walt studios. And then shopping in disney village. You have fast track tickets that you get for one ride and will tell you the time when you can go to the ride so no waiting around.. you dont really go to the front but jump the queue a little bit. So while you get your fast track you have about 1 half hr so in that time you can go to another ride and wait in the queue as normal so you cover 2 rides. We had a lovely time.. do check the weather before going sunny cloudy weather will be nice. Raining is not suitable as your just out in the open just ruins it.,Disneyland_Paris

It is on a much smaller scale to Florida but we liked the idea of hopping from one park to another without having to get on the Disney transportation.We were there in July August yet still it was a little cooler in the evenings if you were staying there after dark. Our tip would be....take warm clothes, a sweater and maybe long trousers for the evening, but to save you having to go back to the car parks, hire a locker (for Disney just off Main St on the right) and put your extra baggage in there then you can change if you feel the need. By our third visit we felt we had it just right!You get the usual great happy Disney service you would expect in Anaheim, it is without exception the worlds happiest magical place.

Everyone recommended that we should get there early, as soon as the park opens   probably good advice, which we probably should have taken! Top tip 1   take lots of water, though there were water fountains where you can top up. Top tip 2.   do not buy a two day pass. You can probably do most, if not all rides in one (exhausting) day. Top Tip 3   do the Lion King Show   great 30 min summary of the West End show.

116685772,2,2011-8,United States,"This is patterned on the original Disneyland with a few cultural variations, but is much smaller. Before you visit, look it up online so you know what to expect. It has the Railroad, Dumbo, Merry Go Round, Autopia, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Jungle Cruise, Tarzan's Tree House, and others, but NO Star Tours, Toon Town, Haunted Mansion, or Pirates of the Caribbean. Food is noodles and rice, with only a single restaurant for western fare. It was refreshing to have covered queue lines, generally with fans, and Small World was even air conditioned. Unfortunately, it seemed like the Jungle Cruise and Small World boats moved quicker than in Anaheim.Besides being smaller than we expected, what lessened the experience was a general lack of accepted protocol by most of the attendees. In Anaheim, we are used to waiting in line. At this park, queues were largely ignored, and people often went around others pushing their way through the line. Even at Small world, where people are lined up in aisles to get into the boats, people would climb over the seats to get where they wanted. At one show, an altercation broke out as people were pushing their way into the theatre. Park staff tried to keep the participants separated and started the show as they were still shouting at each other across the theater. Even on the Jungle Cruise, the driver (They had separate lines for English and Chinese speaking) incessantly admonished riders to keep their hands in the boat (which got very close to moving attraction parts). People seem to talk louder in this part of the world, always shouting no matter how close (or far away) they are.

Unfortunately, there appears to be no limit on how many paying customers are allowed into the park with the most popular rides having 75 90 minute waiting times. What really struck us though was how run down the whole place now looks. In the Village, the shiny Harlequin effect looks like its been in place for about 50 years. The whole place is actually dirty and I find it very hard to believe that the concrete paths are ever pressure washed. For some reason these days there are security check points everywhere which really does take away the pleasure of being there. I have also read other reviews highlighting the smoking in the parks. I agree totally. At one point while waiting for my son and daughter to return from Space Mountain, my eyes began to water because of the number of people smoking.

We bought our tickets through Attraction Tix at a reduced price, taking our paper printed tickets and scannig them was a breeze and we were issued automatically with our park tickets, first time doing this and have to say the reviews we Read were all right it worked very well. We had 3 day tickets that covered both parks which gave us enough time to wait in the queues and enjoy just about every ride.Food outlets are varied but pricey. you can take snacks....not full meals into the park. We did see people eating their own sandwiches though.There are some street traders working on the concourse by the station, if you decide to buy watch their prices.As a confirmed Disney family we enjoyed our return visit, were a bit concerned it would not be as good as Florida but apart from not being as    strict    as the Florida cast members the experience was great.",Disneyland_Paris
278229488,4,2015-5,United Kingdom,"Went as a family with friends,5 adults and 3 children, flew from manchester and stayed in the hotel cheyenne,hotel is basic as in you dont even get a kettle but provides a pleasant enough room for you and reception will give you kettle if you need one, the resturant is busy and more like a cafe and yes you do queue. The park is a 15 minute walk away which seems longer when you have been on your feet all day or you can get a shuttle bus,, the park is good and clean and most toilets i used were spotlessly clean ,however, you find yourself having to queue for almost everything from getting into the park,using the loo,getting food and off coarse the rides which whilst i was there the average queue time was an hour and the quick pass wasnt much better. I would and probably will go back because dispite queuing,disneyland paris is a nice place to go and kids and grown ups can really enjoy themselves it can be expensive if you want to spend money or you can do it on a budget all depends what you want i would recommend taking plenty of snacks and tea n coffee and cordials as they are generally very expensive, on the whole try it for yourselves you may get fed up queuing and feel ripped off but im sure you will enjoy.",Disneyland_Paris

Almost 50 years later, it   s still the happiest place on earth albeit the fantasy wasn   t as real this time around.

Park closes at 6 , so while waiting for the show ( which starts at 8h30) we ate a restaurant ( average food ) .. The show at night is fantastic !!!!!!!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
116249305,5,2011-7,United Kingdom,"We have just had a fantastic time at DLP with our 5 and 6 year olds. On previous visits to Disney in the US, the temptation has been to route march around the park to try and see all the attractions as quickly as possible . We have put off visiting Disney with the children for that reason but actually, they neither needed nor wanted to see all of it. Most of the big queues (e.g. Space Mountain) are for the rides that are inappropriate for them anyway.We stayed in a Disney hotel close to the park which was a good choice as it enabled us to come and go as we pleased, depending on how tired the children were. The extra magic hours meant they could do all the rides they wanted to, first thing in the morning. Back to the hotel for breakfast and to meet some of the characters in the foyer (don't, don't, don't join the long queues in the park   even if you are not staying in a Disney hotel you can call into the hotel foyer areas to meet the characters). Our children then slept in the afternoon and went out again at night for the parades and fireworks. With hindsight, I wish we had taken them sooner.It is well worth planning the trip in advance although it is surprisingly difficult to get hold of the free site map that is given out in the park in advance. Generally, we got a fast pass for one ride and then queued for another which meant you could do two rides in fairly quick succession. The longest we had to queue was 50mins for the Toy Soldier Parachute Drop but it was worth it; despite my reservations, even our 5 year old loved it. Peter Pan, Buzz Lightyear and Slinky Dog were other favourites and there was no queue for It's a Wonderful Life (a boat ride through singing characters from around the world) which all the children loved. Pirates of the Caribbean is a good attraction: another boat ride through an underwater cave like tunnel but it unsettled our two children and they asked never to be taken on anything like that ever again(!). It's not a scary ride by any means but is probably more suitable for slightly older or more robust children   it's often hard to tell until it's too late. Other people have said similar things about the witch on the Snow White ride but ours were unfazed by that. Still, you have to make a judgment call on the day and ours have stopped having nightmares about it now. I expected them to dislike Star Tours (a kind of Star Wars simulator ride) but they loved it.The highlight for us, and a definite must do for any little girl with a princess fixation, was the Princess lunch (or dinner) at Auberge de Cendrillon. This is an expensive meal but the food is excellent and it is cheaper to book in advance. Our 5 year old daughter absolutely adored it. Whilst DLP is not a cheap holiday, we had a great time and will almost certainly go back again. I thought the extra cost of staying in one of the Disney hotels was definitely worthwhile. In this instance, I'm sure it's worth spending the extra money and having shorter or less frequent holidays than trying to do it on a budget. In the park, there are no cheap restaurants as such and those at the cheaper end were overcrowded and busy, offering what looked like fairly poor value.Disney Village (just outside the Park) has more choice and there is also a McDonalds and the Earl of Sandwich selling very nice, reasonably priced toasted paninis on a terrace overlooking the lake. There is also a small supermarket in the train station which sells sandwiches, pasta, drinks and snacks. Be warned though, you aren't allowed to take any food or drink into either the park or Disney village (the station sits between the two). Scary security staff search you and in our case, we were made to take a 2 mile detour around the back of the village to get back to our hotel because we had bought a bottle of wine at the station (at a tenth of the price charged in the hotel)!!We paid for the half board dining plan and pre booked our meals, whether it represents overall good value for money really depends on where you choose to eat. It is definitely a good idea to make advance bookings to avoid queues (there are enough of those in the park itself) and the hotel concierge will do this willingly. If you want to do the Princess lunch and the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show (not on Weds or Thursdays) then it is worth the premium package but otherwise, it definitely isn't. There are two cheaper packages though and prepaying any of them means that you can forget the cost and just get on with enjoying a great family holiday without the gritted teeth....at least until your credit card bill arrives.",Disneyland_Paris
158555434,4,2013-2,Philippines,"I noticed that Disneyland caters more to kids 10 years old and above. The rides are mostly fast and  roller coaster like . My son is just 8 and he was scared when he rode the RC ride in Toy story. After that ride, he didnt like to ride anymore of the others because he got scared. He just rode the Buzz Light Year after.

Firstly, a large area of the Discoveryland and Frontierland are currently boarded off for renovation. Obviously this needs to happen but does destroy the magic to an extent.

117657022,5,2011-9,United Kingdom,"The Disneyland Park won us all over. It was simply brilliant! I went with my husband, and 3 children aged 4, 7 and 8, one who which is disabled.One thing I would recommend is the disney tea party. It was great. The characters interacted with the children briliantly. Minnie even took my little one up to dance which she thought was amazing! We did breakfast at Mickey's cafe in the disney village too, but it didnt really compare. All the characters did was move from table to table posing for a photograph   a little disappointing. But the tea party was great, the high light of our stay. Although I would note that it is sweet food only, much to the children's delight.The fantillusion parade and Fireworks were magical. The best weve ever seen.Our kids loved the flying elephants, it's a small world and the carousel rides, (theyre wimps ;). There's lots of great merchandise to buy although obviously at a price. Brought the girls princess dresses, one of which cost 70 euros! Yes, a bit steep   but it was absolutely beautiful. Much more detailed and better quality than you could buy from shops back home.We were given an easy pass for my child due to her disability, which meant we were able to queue at the exit which was a life saver as she doesn't cope with long queues. Because of the pass we didnt have to wait more than 10 minutes to go on a ride and there was seating in special areas for you to wait at most rides. One of the rides had a queue that was up to a 85 minute wait, so we were really thankful for this pass. You could use the pass on most rides. There was just a handful of rides that it couldn't be used for. You could also use it for the disney character meet and greets and shows. Each ride had a different number of helpers allowed on the ride with the disabled person, ranging from 1 to 7. To get the pass I took my daughters DLA award letter and you need a letter from a health professional saying that the disabled person finds it difficult to stand in a queue for a long period of time. Just go to the city hall on your arrival to show your documents and collect the pass.Anyway, all in all a great park and we will be returning!",Disneyland_Paris

274431740,5,2014-6,United States,"The most striking aspect of Parc Disneyland is its beauty. Having been to the original Disneyland twice and the Magic Kingdom in Orlando twice, I can say that their French counterpart manages to be even lovelier. Many of the rides were comparable to their American counterparts. We loved Phantom Manor; what a great take on the Haunted Mansion ride. The Indiana Jones coaster and Space Mountain 2.0 were extremely thrilling, but Big Thunder Mountain is the best ride in the park. It was also fun to ride the original Star Tours ride in both French and English. Food options were tasty but limited. It seemed that most counter service locations closed early in the evening leaving only table service and buffets. This wasn't too bad for our American appetites accustomed to 5:00PM dinners, but it could pose a problem to locals who eat much later. We also found vegetarian options lacking at both parks. It was pretty much pizza and salad for my companion.Stories of rude castmembers and pushy guests are GREATLY exagerrated. We did go in June of 2014, and attendance was rather low, so that might have made a difference. One thing to keep in mind is that a great deal of the park's guests are from all over Europe and some do not have the same proclivity for personal space as do Americans, British, and French. All in all, the resort was a lovely change of pace to our French vacation. You won't be homesick, that's for sure. The castmembers spoke excellent English, but were more than happy to indulge my college French. I hope to return to Paris in a couple of years and will definitely make Disneyland a must return.",Disneyland_Paris
156930106,5,2013-4,United States,Disneyland is still magical. It was very crowded most of the days we were there but to be expected for this time of year. Highly recommend taking a break middle of the day to come back to hotel and recharge. Both our kids crashed out for a few hours and we were able to eat lunch a bit cheaper before heading back into the park for the evening hours. Be sure to get fast passes for any of the rides you can to save wait times in line. One thing is most of the rides even the smaller ones in Fantasy Land are a bit dark and scary for younger kids. Our four year old struggled with a lot of the rides due to this. Food and merchandise is expensive so plan your budget. We brought food in every day which helped a ton for quick snacks and staying hydrated. Wear comfortable shoes and layer clothes so you can adjust during the day. You need at least two days to fully do the park especially with ride wait times. Try and catch one of the parades as they are fun to see,Disneyland_California
311344056,5,2015-4,United Kingdom,"Had an uncle that used to work for here, in the monorail maintenance shed. We got season passes because of him. It was a young boy's dream. We lived,so close back then I could see the 9 pm fireworks from out of my bedroom window! Later as a college student I had two girlfriends that both worked here, in the same restaurant! Club 33. Sure they compared notes and that's why I 'Lost Out'! Favorite place? Tom sawyer's Island. Favorite Ride? Space mountain with a girl, a teacups with my buddies. We used to bring gloves to wear when turning the teacups very fast. That way you could stop the turning wheel,really quickly and start it up in the opposite direction.

246770193,5,2014-12,Hong Kong,"Going to Disneyland during Christmas was spectacular to say the least. As a local, I never fail to be pleased and inspired by the attractions at Disneyland. For Christmas, it was surprisingly less crowded than I expected. Ride waits were a bit longer than usual, but not unbearable. Ride lines that get significantly longer as the day passes include Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh, Cinderella Carousel and the rides in Toy Story Land, so ride these first if you must. Food quality was as usual, though I'd suggest to choose your restaurant carefully...you may not get what you initially wanted! Definitely requires a full day on a holiday like Christmas. For tourists, I would advise them to buy tickets at the Disneyland Ticket Express in Central Hong Kong MTR station, as this can save the lining up at the park entrance (provided that you will definitely be going, rain or shine!). There is quite a bit to do all in all, and make sure you use the fastpass facility to save some time for Space Mountain and Winnie the Pooh. Restaurants mostly crowded at about 1 pm in my experience, eat either before or after that peak time. For the live shows, try and finish them earlier as you may find that they become more hard to line up for at the end of the day! Same goes for character greetings; keep in mind that the characters do change and swop throughout the day, so line up early for these?For live shows and parades and the like, make sure you are ready and waiting about 20 30 minutes before they start; crowds tend to appear around 10 15 minutes before they begin. Plenty of time for shopping at the end so leave this until after the fireworks. For the fireworks, sitting down near the front provides the most magical experience, though you must be at least half an hour early. Overall, loved visiting Disneyland for the nth time and I can't wait to go there again!",Disneyland_HongKong
436469478,3,2016-10,Australia,This would be a great disney experience for families with small children as there are lots of character photo ops and park is fairly compact.After visiting Disneyworld and Disneyland this was a bit of a let down.

153843390,5,2013-3,Trinidad and Tobago,"We have two daughters ages 9 and 7, and had a magical time at HKDL. We visited to celebrate my daughter   s birthday and mine. The staff was overly friendly and always eager to wish us happy birthdays. Yes a few had some choppy English, but given they know more English than I know Mandarin or Cantonese, I was more than grateful.Looking at the map, we counted about 15 or 16 true rides. Yes, it   s not as big as Florida or California, but for us there is some advantage to it being smaller   less walking! You can easily see and do everything you want in a day, and in two days it is absolutely pressure free. Just relax, show up at the park, leisurely stroll around and see the attractions you want. Our two day tickets for a family of four were about $200 US. Way cheaper than what you   ll pay in the States. Adding a second day was only about $40 extra for the whole family.We stayed Friday through Sunday nights at the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel (more on that in our hotel post). It   s about a 20 minute taxi ride from the airport at a cost of about $25 US. We went to the park on Saturday and Sunday. Overall, there really wasn   t much in the way of lines or waiting. Typical wait time was 5 to 20 minutes, except for Autopia 60 minutes and Pooh 45 minutes. I understand Pooh being long with kids and all, but Autopia? Only thing I can think of is that fewer folks have or drive cars in HK, so getting that experience is fun. Second day we went straight to Autopia as soon as the park opened and got it done for our girls.To break things up and potentially avoid the busiest time at the park, we went to downtown Hong Kong mid day on Saturday. Worked out beautiful. Park in the morning, city in the afternoon, and then back to the park for some line free rides for a couple of hours just before the fire works. As a general note, it seemed like after the 3:30 parade there was a large group of folks exiting.All said, would we go back? Sure, if we   re missing some Disney. It   s close to us in Perth, cheaper than traveling to the US or Japan, and two days versus spending a whole week at Disney feels about right.One last tip, if staying at the HKDL Hotel it is only about a 10 minute walk (we timed it) to the park entrance where Mickey is surfing the whale   s water spout. You can take the bus, which will take just about as much time.Oh and before I forget, we really did not witness any of the line cutting others have complained about. I   m guessing it exists for major holidays when the crowds swell, but for the two days we were there we did not have one bad experience.",Disneyland_HongKong

When we went back to one of the stores to check if we dropped it there while paying for merchandise the store lady was very rude. She rudely asked bow do we know it's your even if we find it. I asked her how many other people have come looking for their food vouchers, she said none. I couldn't believe how crass these people were. We requested the reception to reprint the voucher since they had bar code and they refused saying they can't. This just shows how backward their technology is. It's not a big deal to reprint the same bar code. If someone had already used our voucher the bar code wouldn't work anyway so no harm in reprinting it.We were there during the Christmas holidays.

Having all kids under 5 we planned our way only aiming to go where the kids were big enough to ride. If you want to avoid crowds try doing it backwards so go against the traffic ie instead of going left go right. Also bring snacks and drinks which you might have to hide in your bag. The parade happens every Night so it's a good idea to check times and go maybe 20'mins before it starts so you get a good view as the good spots get crowded very quickly. Getting there and going home is very easy. They have a good organised transport system whether you choose mrt or taxi. If you can't afford staying at the hotel it's very easy to go there ,Disneyland_HongKong
401066467,4,2016-8,United Kingdom,"The park is OK, but considerably smaller than Orlando. The queues for rides were far too long for the length of the rides. I don't think you should have to queue 50 mins for a ride that lasts around 3 mins and a few of the main rides were closed, which is disappointing in the middle of Summer. The food is ridiculously expensive for the quality of food and I would say it's considerably more expensive than Orlando. The park does have a very similar look and experience to Orlando, although not quite hitting the same heights. The fireworks, laser and projection show Disney Dreams on the Princess Castle are superb and we'll worth the wait until 11:00pm to watch it. There are a few shows rides which are excellent and we'll worth the wait. Mickey and the Magician, space mountain 2 and Ratatouille to name a few. The lack of fast passes available is a downside, I think there were only 2 available, where in Orlando you can fast pass most rides. One other major disappointment is the lack of WiFi in any of the Disney Paris parks. In this day and age I just don't understand having no WiFi when most people want to update social networks and share their experiences of the parks, which is free advertising for Disney, so if you don't have an expensive roaming data package, you're screwed until you get back to your hotel.

151137018,5,2012-12,United States,"Two of my friends and myself took a quick trip to Disneyland just before Christmas and I have to comment on something new they did this year. They had a 500 piece choir and symphony set up right in front of Main Street. They had soloists and Kurt Russell read the birth of Christ. At first I didn't think we would be able to see it as there were certain people who were invited and had special tickets, but just like Fantasmic you can stand or sit and watch. I was blown away as they marched in with candles and formed a live Christmas tree and listened to the orchestra and choir perform all the classic spiritual Christmas songs. I was just so impressed that they actually acknowledged the most important part of Christmas and actually the main reason that it is celebrated in the first place, Good for you Disney!!!!! Please keep doing this!",Disneyland_California

I can tell you I did not want to go, however, once we got there the magic of Disney took over and I was in there with my grown self having the most wonderful time. I recommend this park for everyone, not just kids! Disney got the whole concept of theme park on lock. I had the best time not one thing to complain about with this experience.

Some rides had up to 120min wait time, which puts you off big time.Apparently, if you want to enjoy what's left of the park, you should avoid 15th of May to 15th of October, but then it's probably colder.All the prices went up A LOT in the last 3 years since our last visit, like an average T shirt from 9 10 Euros to 25 30 Euros.",Disneyland_Paris

But upon arriving via disney train, I barely can hear the music or feel the disney ish, compared to other disney park. It's quite hot and uncomfortable (July), and lots of people (not sure mainlanders or what) who tend to skip queue, pushing and squeezing themselves around other people. Not comfortable at all. The Disney figure are available at dedicated hotspot for photo taking, unlike other disney park, they are running everywhere and you can easily catch them without the need to queue for almost 1 hour. The parade is fun, and they interact with the audience very well. Food stall are all sufficient enough. There are also halal muslim food at Adventureland which is quite a relieve. But they dont have plenty choices of popcorn bucket as souvenirs, or even slushies cup. Everything seems so expensive here, I wonder why.",Disneyland_HongKong
560851065,4,2018-2,United States,"We just came back. Great experience, courteous staff, tidy park, though its starting to look dated in places. We stayed in the Hotel New York which is due to close shortly for renovation, and it shows.It was about  1c when we arrived the first day, and there was a noticeable lack of characters out wandering around and interacting with visitors. Further a number of rides were closed, though it wasnt made clear if they were closed due to the cold and snow or if they were being updated. On the Saturday some more of them opened up as it was sunny and warmer (about 5c!) and the Disney characters that had deserted the place arrived back.Observations  its not as big or as cool as the US one   sorry.  There are less characters around in the park interacting with guests. Many of the 'meet the characters' were behind large queues and closed doors. I am sure in the US park when we have been there previously, many characters just randomly appeared during the day and interacted with visitors, which was part of the magic.  The cost of food at the Disney Village restaurants was horrendous. (See below)  Very good for younger kids, but only about 3 thrill seeker rides for teenagers.Tips  If its winter wrap up warm and if its icy expect some of your Disney characters to be staying at home.  Look carefully at any meal deals voucher options when you book. The Meal Plus voucher is worth approximately 36EUR against either an all you can eat buffet , a fixed menu in some places, OR as a 36EUR contribution to the other menus  If buffets are your thing we noticed that they get fully booked at weekend ,but not so much during the week.  if you dont have food vouchers expect to part with 35   70 (!) EUR for a meal OR live on burgers from McDonalds or their own burger place with a huge queue and horrid burgers.  Breakfast is about 15EUR for a croissant, orange juce and a small baguette.",Disneyland_Paris

301735331,3,2015-8,United Kingdom,"We are two over 60,s and had invested in an annual pass last November and decided it would be a waste to not use it again, we really enjoyed it and with the extra hours managed to get on rides with out waiting for to long. We had pre booked meals about three weeks before , if you go to guest services when you arrive at the park they will print you off a receipt for the meals. The park is having a well needed make over so a few attractions will be closed but overall it is starting to look better especially the planting. My biggest complaint is the smoking why with so many children in the park people cant cut out smoking or just go to a designated area. It is not just the French either  Disney are so quick to ban selfie sticks with signs up now why on earth they cant ban smoking I don't know",Disneyland_Paris
572116619,4,2018-3,United Kingdom,"We visited Disneyland Paris at the end of March, which I had previously researched as being the quietest time of the year. The park, however, was very busy. We had a fantastic time and found staff very helpful. The food is very expensive, which is a shame because less people would bring their own food, if the restaurants were more reasonably priced. The main problem, which we encountered was that we needed a Disability Pass for our daughter, who uses a wheelchair. I had contacted Disney, prior to our visit to ask how to obtain the Disability Pass. I was informed to proceed to Guest Relations, or the Donald Desk. We arrived at the car park at 9.20 a.m. and could not find any member of staff then to enquire where to go, so we joined the queue at Guest Relations. Eventually, after quite some time, we saw a member of staff, who had to rescue us from the Guest Relations queue, as it was by then very lengthy and we could not easily manoeuvre a wheelchair to get out of the crowd of people ahead and behind us. It was becoming dangerous. We were then put into another quite lengthy queue at a small window. Guest Relations and the small window distributing Disability Passes open at 10 a.m. Donald's Desk, where we had been instructed to go to prior to our visit, was open, but was unmanned throughout. The queue at the small window issuing Disability Passes then became massive. This was on a weekday morning and not on a weekend, when we would expect the park to be more busy. I thought it was exceptionally poor management that other members of staff were not sent to help and another window desk opened. It was evident to everyone that there was a major problem. It must have been difficult for Management to ignore. It was also bitterly cold weather for people to wait in the queue. Some families were clearly encountering problems with their enquiries and that meant that the queue was at a standstill. Still no one came to help. There could be no blame apportioned to the young man, who eventually issued the pass to us, as he was efficient and helpful. In fact, he needed to be applauded for not showing panic at the size of the queue. We entered the gates of the park, shortly after 11 a.m., but it would be nothing short of a miracle, if the other people in the queue were attended to before 12.30 p.m. The Management of Disneyland Paris really need to get their act together in this area. Nevertheless, we try to concentrate on the positive aspects of our three day visit and we did otherwise have a wonderful, magical time and the Disability Pass was extremely helpful to us.",Disneyland_Paris
127148227,3,2012-3,United States,I have visited DisneyWorld in Florida many times and in my opinion; Disneyland does not compare. Disneyland is much smaller with long lines to mostly all of the attractions. We visited mid week before the spring break crowds in March.

324281807,4,2015-10,United States,"First, the good stuff from an American Family:1) Disneyland Paris was great when our American Family was super concerned that our passports and credit cards got stolen in one of the bathrooms. When we thought all hope was lost, we were directed to City Hall on MainStreet for assistance. Long story short   the folks at Disney did a great job helping us with fixing our problem. Within 60 minutes of our problem, our wallet was found and everything except our cash was accounted for. Thank you to the good folks at Disney for saving our vacation from disaster2) As a long time participant at Disney Orlando, I just have to say a few things. People in the US do not cut the line, do not jump over 'closed' lines, and do not press up against each other as if personal space were no issue. Be aware   if you go to Disneyland Paris a) there is no supervision of any line or attraction and b) strangers will press their bodies against you as if to intimidate you to let them move ahead of you in line.c) anybody and everybody will cut in front of you, given the opportunity3) Disneyland Paris can be done in one day. Period. Do not let any other sight or attraction convince you otherwise. Make sure you see Ratatouille   it is the most advanced technological ride I have ever seen. Other than that, just go with your gut instinct. The Peter Pan ride had a 90 minute wait, which we fast passed. The whole ride lasted about 2 minutes. Just think carefully about what you have already seen in Orlando, and make informed decisions for Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

On crowded days however you'll find some are quite rude and not aware they work in one of the happiest places on earth and should play their role to make your visit unforgetable. Same goes for the visitors, some get so stessed and unpleasent because they only want to get on as many rides as possible and everyone else is in their way. On those kind of days it's better not to visit the popular rides but instead visit Adventure Isle, the Secrets of the Nautilus or enjoy the beauty of the arcades behind Mainstreet.The FastPass system can be very helpfull to plan your visit but we never actually plan a whole day, except for the parades and Enchanted fireworks, nothing beats the magic of seeing Sleeping Beauty's castle surrounded by Fireworks. It's DisneyMagic at it's best. (After the Fireworks the park closes but it's still possible to do some shopping in Mainstreet) Keep in mind that it's not possible to see all of the park or ride every ride in just one day. Get to the parkgates half an hour before opening, the French or not that strict and sometimes the gates open earlier, this gives you the chance to get on Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain or any other popular ride without having to stand in line too long. Make dinner reservations at City Hall so you can enjoy a good meal at one of the (child ) friendly restaurant instead of eating at an overcrowded fast foodrestaurant. The ' Once Upon a Dream' parade and 'Fantillusion'parade are somthing not to be missed, take your positions in time for a good view.

389191570,3,2016-6,United States,"We visited Disneyland with three day tickets (one of those days we went to California Adventure) in the third week of June. Our three day tickets included a  magic morning  that allowed us into the park one hour early on one day (it's only on certain days so check ahead). The magic morning was great   we got in three rides in the first hour with short lines and saw half of Tomorrowland in just the one hour. Then everyone who didn't have the magic morning showed up. There were throngs of people everyone, lines ballooned to ridiculous wait times, and through most of the day we only got a fraction of our planned itinerary done (the Matterhorn was an exception as for a more major ride it's line stayed a more reasonable 40 50 minutes even in the middle of the day). The kids in the group started to get tired and fussy around 7 or 8 p.m. so we went back to our hotel to put them to bed. Later, a few of us adults went back to the park for the last hours before close. This was an excellent idea as we got a lot done in just a couple hours as crowds died down (though Indiana Jones and Space Mountain kept their long lines). We rode Indiana Jones through the single rider line and still waited about 40 minutes, decided to skip Space Mountain due to an hour and 40 minute wait just minutes before close (the advertised closing time is when they close the entrance to the line, but if you are in line before closing time you still get to ride). Technically we could have made it to the Space Mountain line before the park closed but it would have been 12:30 or later by the time we finished the ride. On a side note it's an excellent idea to get one of the apps that give you fairly accurate real time wait times for all the rides in the park. Instead of Space Mountain we rushed over to Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, waited maybe 10 minutes or less and had a blast riding it at night, then ran over to Splash Mountain just before the line closed and had no wait at all. It seems silly, but we almost could have come for just the first hour and last hour and still done about a third of the things we did in an entire day. Realistically, it would have been a good idea to take the kids back to the hotel for a break nap midday when the crowds were their worst, enjoyed the pool and hot tub, and come back rested for the later hours when the crowds die down a bit. Everything you hear and read about how great Disney is are true, but the huge crowds and terrible wait times make it almost not worth it. Almost. It is Disneyland after all.",Disneyland_California

It is convenient from the airport, and there is also a luggage valet service so you can check your bags before entering the park. The park is rather small, as I have been to Disney World a couple times, it is MUCH smaller! I was able to quickly walk through all of the areas (I skipped it's a small world, been there  done that!) in just 90 minutes!!! I also got there shortly after they opened on a Monday, so it was not super busy which was great. It cost about $70 USD, and if I had been there all day, it would have been a fair value. There were a couple restaurants closed and a couple rides closed, that's why I gave it 4 stars. The rides I decided to go on, I had a mere 5 minute wait, which was great, no need for the Express Pass! Most of the princesses characters had no more then 15 minutes wait time, some I were able to just walk up to and get a photo that quick!! The longest line was at opening for photos with Holiday Mickey and Minnie  I would guess it would have been about an hour. For those who have been to DisneyWorld  the main Castle here is Sleeping Beauty's, so it's MUCH smaller. Also, TomorrowLand is MUCH smaller as well. There is also a Main St USA, so it has a lot of familiarity! Overall it was a great experience, just wish all of the rides had been open!!",Disneyland_HongKong
638663852,4,2018-12,United States,"our 3 day trip to Disneyland Paris was a lovely family weekend and we had a really good weekend. It had all the usual Disney elements that make it a wonderful experience, there were just a few small things over the weekend that took the whole experience to good instead of great!Food was a really problem over the whole 3 days. There are simply not enough places to grab something on the go in park. The French seem to completely misunderstand the concept of 'fast' food as the counter service places that were open were ridiculously slow to get served & when you are visiting a park for the attractions, rides, shows and parades this is just unacceptable. Twice we experienced food stands being shut or service points closing when there were huge queues   not at all customer service focused.Secondly, we were on the half board deal but there were so few places we were able to use this that we ended up not really using this   maybe that's the idea. It worked when we had booked dinner weeks before, but we didn't know definite plans on other days and just couldn't get a table anywhere and the counter service places were a non starter as we didn't want to spend an hour queueing.Leaving the park after the evening show was horrendous. It is so utterly disorganised with people trying to push through in 2 directions, instead of staff organising some sort of one way system   I would hate to have had a push chair!Extra magic hours were good although very geared towards younger visitors in Disneyland Park and it would be good if they opened another more grown up ride.",Disneyland_Paris
162078048,1,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Have just returned from a weekend of hell in Disneyland Paris! Being a BIG Disney fan I'm horrified to say it was the worst holiday we have had. On arrival   We had pre booked tickets and still had to queue for hours with the people who were buying their tickets! What's the point of pre booking? We were then disgusted to be greeted by a rude cashier!Once in the park   Rides and shops shut. Many without explanation, even when you ask staff! we just got told it was closed, you can kind of see that as there is a rope across it! The staff member was rude and clearly did not was to be there. By the end of the weekend I was fed up with the amount of closed signs. Its peak season why so much closed? The rides which were open half the carriages were broke! which was causing long queues. The fast passes were ridiculous either sold out or too late in the day. So we didn't get much done at all, complete waste of money. We was not going to queue for hours for a 2 minute ride! Actually witnessed a staff member being very rude to a women when she asked him about a time on fast pass. The food and drink were over priced and not exactly worth it. 20th Anniversary? well this was a complete disappointment. Castle was closed off during the day to prepare for the show at 11pm (lots of disappointed people in few minutes we were there) only 1 parade which was not until 7pm. Disney Dreams was a complete mess. People pushing each other out of the way I was pushed and shouted at by one women for walking out of the crowd as was so fed up with seeing nothing!! Overall a complete disappointment & won't be revisiting!",Disneyland_Paris
382988330,2,2016-6,Australia,"This place may be good if you have young children. Granted, we visited on a busy Sunday afternoon and evening, however the park should be built with crowds in mind. We only visited the Disneyland Park, not the adjoining park...thank goodness for that.For adults I think it is a big disappointment if you are trying to follow your childhood dreams.The place looks dated and old. It was surprisingly small in area. The crowds were crammed in. You had to queue for everything, and I mean everything. Food, rides and toilets meant a queue.The fast pass system was great until staff say that they are not issuing fast passes for  whatever  ride anymore.We managed to use two rides or attractions during our 7.5 hour stay. Temple of Doom and Haunted Mansion.The food was terrible, couldn't even find a hotdog in the USA! Again, more and more queuing.I have never seen so many children crying and upset in one place.The best aspects of the park were the character staff. They did an excellent job. Store staff were not as enthusiastic. So many young people in the park were doing a great job. The saving grace of the experience was the day and night parades. They were brilliant and again, character staff saved the day. The fireworks were excellent as well. At times being obviously  watched  by security staff was off putting.I would not recommend this park for adults, go to the other parks in LA.We had an issue with ticketing that was very well handled by staff, can't fault them on that.It may be worth just going for the parades but don't get your hopes up for the other attractions if it is a busy time.",Disneyland_California

And I must say, I was definately disappointed!It was magical   let's just say I nearly cried when I saw Minnie Mouse as she was my favourite as a 6 year old. haha.The rides are not exactly for thrill seekers and I feel as if the park is for mainly kids and families but if you're a big kid like me that will always love the world of Disney, then it's for you. The park is divided up into different areas for different themes so that keeps you on your toes, making you want to see all of it.We ate at the ice cream bar on the main street and you get exactly what you paid for! I did not think it was over priced and I was on a budget!Be sure to get a good spot to watch the parade too! I'd advise to get food straight after it, as the food lines before the parade are pretty hectic.",Disneyland_California
625623706,4,2018-10,India,"Very well organised place, good fun to spend a day with kids. If you plan well, can enjoy all the shows in a day's trip. However, timings for meeting various characters should be increased, especially if the crowds are large.",Disneyland_HongKong
211832028,4,2014-6,United States,"Disneyland in California shows no signs of aging. The park is kept immaculately clean and all of the staff have a ready smile and are eager to help you in any way possible. The park is much smaller than Disney World in Orlando and can sometimes feel very crowded, especially in Adventure Land. Food is good, pricey but all of the portions are very large and easily shareable.there are also dining options at California Adventure and Downtown Disney, as well as, in the immediate area just off property. Just remember to get your hand stamped for re entry into the park.One of my favorite rides is still the Jungle Cruise. Having ridden many times, we recently had the pleasure of riding with Captain Eddie, a young man from Illinois. Although I new most of the jokes, I have not laughed that hard in a long time. His delivery was so dead pan and right on target that the entire script felt fresh and new. He kept the entire boat engaged and made us feel like we were all his closest friends. Be sure to ask for his boat and enjoy the ride.",Disneyland_California

477359395,5,2017-1,Australia,"While it is the smallest of the parks we have visited, it feels like Hong Kong Disney opted for quality vs quantity. We found it refreshing to be able to see the park without rushing from ride to ride to see everything. As hotel guests, we were fortunate enough to be able to experience Iron Man, which was in its soft opening phase, and space mountain still had the Star Wars overlay. But it was the unique takes they had on rides that resulted in my two thumbs up. Mystic Manor was amazing, Grizzly Gulch was a good thrill and Jungle Cruise has it's own unique twist. Even more impressive was the in park dining. It was brilliant to walk away from a quick service meal having had something equally tasty and healthy. I admired the multilingual approach that rides took, often catering for Cantonese, Mandarin and English languages in clever ways. The best example of this was Mickey and the Wonderous Book. The only downside we found was the photopass, which operates and the same system as Shanghai, and there are simply not enough photopass photo opportunities!As we wanted to visit for three days and the tickets offered were a maximum of two days, we were recommended to look at upgrading to an annual pass, which we did and as a result have tacked Hong Kong onto our Tokyo trip.

616038030,5,2018-9,Australia,"We went to Disneyland on a Monday and California adventure on a Tuesday. Because of this we didn   t see the fireworks but we were ok with that. Disneyland  exceeded my expectations. I am glad we attended in the low season as we were nearly able to go on every ride in the park. With a standard ticket purchase you are able to use the fast pass machines. These were great to use to make sure we got to go on the popular rides and didn   t wait long in line allowing us plenty of time to walk between and see all the different worlds. We arrived when the park opened at 9am and stayed until it closed at 10pm. It was a long day but we feel we definitely got our money   s worth and there are plenty of nice shady spots in the park to sit and have a rest throughout the day. Food  we packed our own snacks and sandwiches for lunch. The food inside the park is a little on the expensive side as you would expect. There are are healthy foods for sale which I was pleasantly surprised to see. Corn on the cob, watermelon, cut up veggies, grapes etc. there is also Starbucks Coffee on site. ",Disneyland_California

167891836,5,2013-7,Lebanon,"Review Disney: take the time to read the below; 5 days experience noted in details; the best thing in Disney is the prior know how that will make or break your vacation.  LOGISTICS: the most important thing is the logistics; get a back bag to put the stuff in it; the    exclusive    Vittel water has a funny taste that kids may not like; so if you have kids that may need milk; get your water from airport before heading to Disney. Also Make sure that you reserve the restaurants before getting there for the best time; sunscreen, caps, etc   .. The Stroller is a must; bring one with you if it is light or rent one there; the fee is 15 euros per day and you get the chance to use it at both parks for same day if you plan to go on both parks. (keep the receipt with you in case someone accidentally takes your rented stroller)HOTEL: if you can afford it; stay in Disney hotels; the extra you pay is worth it. Starting from skipping the hassle of security; to queuing for tickets. I stayed at NY hotel and had the privilege of going back after the Parade at 7:30 for a 2.5 hours swimming, relaxing, dinner break before hitting the park again for the 20th anniversary show. Not to mention that every day you will have the Characters showing up at your hotel; thus a great opportunity for autographs and pics. TRANSPORTATION: you can reserve the VEA shuttle; it will cost 20 euors plus or minus per person; if you are agroup of 4; take a taxi; it will get you to your hotel in half the time. if you are staying for a longer period; then the Shuttle experince is nice for the kids and offers them an opportunity to see other hotels. no need to reserve online as the shuttles are not always full; they leave every 45 minutes and are easy to detect at gate 8. RESTAURANTS: again; if you can afford it; if you are staying in Disney buy the half board option; you get the choice of best restaurants at the park and lots of them have a buffet that is great for kids tastes and choice especially if they are coming from abroad. The best timing is breakfast at 9:30; lunch at 3:00 (unless it is at Caf   Mickey; then you need to reserve earlier as characters stop showing at 3: pm) and dinner at 9:30. This gives you the best time to watch the Parades; have fun, and actually have fun. Again if you can afford it; a reservation at Auberege De Cendrillon is worth the time; (the food is average); yet your kids will meet 3 princess at once! You can reserve your restos at the Concierge or at the entrance of the park on the left hand side when you enter. PARADES: unfortunately; the Parade at Disney is a nightmare; you have to sit as early as 6 pm to reserve a place at the sidewalk to enjoy the show; what make things worse are the people who careless about children and stand thus preventing kids from seeing the show. Make sure that you reserve a decent seat at 6:30 pm in the shade. You don   t have to worry about the 4 pm Parade at the studios as they start at 4pm; with lots of space, enjoyable experience and much much less people. CHARACTERS AUTOGRAPHS the Walt Disney Studios is the best for collecting them; you can have access to marry Poppins, Cinderella, Stitch, Mulan, etc    with relatively accessible and fast ques. The princess Pavillion is nice; you have to go there to get the tickets for the appointment; the distribution times are 10:30; 11:45; 13:45 and 16:45 (next to the Mulan windmill). Go there 15 minutes before; if you don   t want your kids to que for distribution; take their access tickets for Disney and just show them how many you have. you will get access for the number of park access cards you show them. they can   t tell which princess timing is; so you have to count on luck. RIDES ATTRACTIONS if you have kids less than 5 or daughters; then Fantasyland is your destination; avoid Dumbo trap and Carrousel; go for the it   s a small world section, Peter Pan, Railroad station, Pinocchio world, sleeping beauty, dragon dungeon, Alice   s maze, Le Pays de Conte de Fe. If you have boys; go to Adventure land and have fun with the Pirates rides as well as Discovery land with Buzz. If you have a mix crowd; best is: peter Pan, it   s a small world, Alice   s maze, pirates rides and boats plus Buzz world. STUDIOS: depending on the weather forecast; choose your visit to coincide with windy or rainy weather as most of attractions are indoor; start with Animagique; Cinemagique; Stitch Live, Disney play house (for kids less than 5); the action motor show and dine at the restaurant of the Stars where you get to watch Ratatouille show. Remember the Parade is at 4 pm; so leave the motor stunt show till after the ride. If you have the time; go to the Hollywood production set. Face paintings is a must for kids as it gets them to live the experience; while at the Studios it is conveniently at the entrance; unfortunately in the park it is inconveniently behind the Castle!the Studios close at 7 pm; so you have teh time to watch the other Parade if you would like to run for it. however, if you end up shouting on your kids and drag them to watch the Parade (as we saw some parents doing); then it wont be that memorable experience for them!!! FAST PASS: asked for an upgrade to a Suite while at the hotel; the cost was not cheap; yet significantly lower than when I wanted to book the suite over the phone. Bottom line, you get an easy pass and a fast pass throughput your stay at Disney. The cost of the upgrade was less than the cost of 4 Fastpass of 240 euros per day for a party of 4. It was WORTH it big time; you pay more, but believe me, cost efficient in Disney does not mean Cheapest; it is Value for money and we had the chance with the Fast pass to take some rides twice, have a breakfast at a designated area in the hotel (less crowded) with Characters showing up. I say what the hell; if it is a once in a life time vacation for your kids; do it the right way and save the extra 100 euros per month for the upgrades that will make a BIG difference for kids and a more relaxing experience for Adults. THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY SHOW: this is a MUST WATCH; do not kill yourself trying to get closer to the round about where it is hectic, crowded and again careless adults obstruct the kids eyesight. Stand at the end of the Main street facing the Castle. I am talking from experience, had 4 nights to watch; the best was the two ones that we distanced ourselves a bit to the back; less crowds; better visibility and you don   t get smashed when the show is over. Don   t kill yourself videotaping it; you will find much better quality on YouTube for your kids watching later; take only some pics for the little ones watching it. i spent more times watching th enchantment, magic effect and expressions on my kids faces rather than the actual shows. Finally I would say that Disney is a vacation for kids; a memorable experience; do NOT try to impose the rides that you may think they will like; if they prefer to stand 20 minutes looking at the dragon so be it. Again, I reiterate that you consider where to stay; it I true that the intention is the park and the hotel is only a stop. Yet, with the right hotel, services, you can relax more, charge up faster and be ready for the adventure. We stayed 4 nights  5 days and it is more than enough; the minimum is 3 nights ( you need 8 hours for teh park including dining and resting and 6 hours for teh studios as it is tied to the shows); I won   t recommend any stay less than 3 nights unless you and your kids are related to Ussain Bolt and have the genes of marathon runner Gebri Selassie.",Disneyland_Paris

261213689,3,2015-3,Spain,"We have just returned from our first family trip to Eurodisney Disneyland Paris. I have tried to put together a note on issues, recommendations and otherwise to facilitate all future holiday planners when considering a trip to Disney Europe.Prior to our trip, I had talked to friends that had previously gone and the one comment was    I hope you have better luck queuing than us   . Not a totally positive message but always followed by    the kids enjoyed it   .We booked through El Corte Ingles and they were very helpful with the booking process while not having any specifics to share worth regard to the proposed experience, hence this critique. The booking options for a first timer are difficult to follow as you do not know what to expect. This is not a reflection on either the customer or the seller (Disney). It is a complex collection of options, hotels, price packages, etc.We were booked through Vueling from Terminal 4 in Madrid to Terminal 3 Charles de Gaulle Paris. The flight timings were as expected and overall the journey was well managed. I would point out that the connection to the VEA bus to bring us directly to Disneyland was a bit more complicated than expected. Once you read the small print on the booking form, it all made sense. First exit Terminal 3 Arrivals (a small terminal which Knock Airport in deepest Mayo would probably put to shame). Walk 300 meters to the right and arrive eventually at the train terminal. Look for signs marked CDGVAL and using this driverless train connection transfer to terminal 2. Look for Gate 8 and turn right until you arrive at the VEA Gate for transfer to Disneyland. There were two VEA representatives on route. We missed the first one as she was sitting in the background and not really paying much attention to arriving passengers. It was only after we net the second representative, who directly us nicely to the actual departure point ,that we realized who the first person was. The bus trip took about 45 minutes and the bus schedule was approximately one every hour. In order not to be hanging around for long periods it is worth following up on the actual bus schedules prior to arrival.With regard to hotel options, I can only go on first impressions as we passed through four on our way to our own hotel.     The first was the Newport Bay. This was an extremely large hotel that seems to be undergoing an extensive refurbishment to three quarter of the facility. I do not know the impact on the residents but it would have caused me concern on first sight.    The second was the Sequoia Lodge. This seemed a nice set up visually but I cannot comment more than that.    The third was the Santa Fe and first impression left me cold and I considered it extremely ugly especially with the big hoarding of Lightning McQueen over the entrance area. I was so glad we were not stopping there. Please read further to allay some of my first misgivings.    The last stop was the Cheyenne where we were staying. First impressions were very good and the visual impact of the small Western village look was very good.On entry to the hotel, a vision of mayhem unfurled. A long queue with no seeming purpose extended for a distance of maybe 30 metres. We were handed forms to fill out which covered details already provided in booking process. On arrival at the actual reception desk, extensive paperwork and tickets were provided but instructions were delivered by rote by the attendant and when asked specific questions she did not want to deviate from planned script. The use of the provided vouchers can be complicated as it is limited to a specific set of restaurants and also in the case of accompanying drinks (non alcoholic only) to a specific set depending on restaurant, i.e., if expecting to include milk for a baby bottle, be ready to be disappointed. The mid afternoon snack is a great idea but again limited to a doughnut or an ice cream (variety depending on the restaurant at which you order). I do not understand in this day and age why so much paper and laminated tickets had to be provided to avail of the facilities. Every morning we had to check we had the relevant vouchers for the day. Surely a simple magnetic coded card can simplify the whole process for both the supplier and the customer. The check in process took about an hour and a bit. I think that as part of that process they should also ask whether a Hair Dryer or Kettle will be required as otherwise you will have to queue again at the alternate reception to order and pay a deposit (25 euros for each item) for same. We were then informed that our room would not be ready until 3pm, we had arrived at 10.30am. If we had been aware of this we could have planned and or adjusted our travel accordingly.  Languages were catered for very well in our hotel (French, Spanish and English) and in the park generally. There were some restaurant staff would did not have language competencies but these were few and far between.We then had to book a lunch in the hotel (all meals required booking beforehand). This involved queuing again (maybe getting you prepared for the days ahead) for 45 minutes at the alternate reception desk.I have to recommend the luggage holding facilities as being very efficient and so useful on both arrival and departure days. The personnel were extremely friendly and helpful.There were no real children entertainment activities in the hotel proper. There was a games room but more aimed at teenagers rather than the younger ones which I believe the park is primarily aimed at. There were more kids entertainment options across the way in the Sante Fe but we did not know any of this at this stage.We had a bit of time to spare prior to lunch but the kids wanted a snack. We went to the hotel shop and bought a packet of crisp for something like    3.40. This was our first exposure to the Disney price markup. Take a regular price and add 50% markup. One useful tip for everybody staying in Disney hotel, go to the train station (on site) and buy your crisps and chocolate snacks for half the price from the station vending machines.We had our lunch in the hotel using the vouchers provided. The meals are all buffet style. The vouchers we had allowed access to a number of difference restaurants in the Disneyland complex, from other hotels e.g., Cantina in the Santa Fe, to ones situated in the park proper. The food quality was adequate without being exceptional. I reckon all the restaurants included in the options are using the same provision source as ALL the food is the same. The only exception is the Agrabar, which I would definitely recommend for adults (better service as well) but the food is a bit spicy (not in the hot sense) for children. You are provided with a limited set of options for your drinks. There is no Trina (non gas) option and, more importantly, if you want milk for a baby they will want to charge you for it (   2.60). Please see individual restaurant notes for exceptions to this policy. I cannot say the staff serving were that welcoming but rather were doing what they had to do.Once we got to our room, the first impression is of a dated nature to the facility driven more by the wear and tear of the rooms    entrance ways and the room itself. Nothing was dirty but it did show an accumulation of grime from age rather than anything else. That said, it was still clean and we had no issues.Now for the park proper. First day we set off and it is only a 15 minute walk to the village with another 15 minutes to the park. I messed up on the initial visit as I did not understand which tickets were meant for the parks. They were very good and gave us one off ticket replaces for that day. Again with a simple ticketing system, none of this would be necessary. We were very luck on our visit as we were there for five days and the first 3 had excellent weather. The park is a different prospect in cold or rainy weather.When planning your trip, you should really learn as much as you can of the rides available and how they suit the age profile of your kids. There can be much disappointment and wasteful days if you do not have a plan. If the weather is good, queuing is not so bad but if cold or wet prepare yourself for a horrible experience. The extra hours option that comes with staying in the complex hotels cannot be underestimated. The majority of our kids entertainment was done at this time. However, only an EXTREMELY limited set of attractions are open at this time and primarily for the 7 and under age group.Given the park is aimed at kids primarily (with the exception of maybe 3 rides) queuing with kids is probably the biggest drawback of the entire visit. There is nothing to do but wait and try and distract your children as best you can. On our last day, we visited the studios at 11.30am and our 6 year old wanted just Ratatouille and the Nemo rides. Both rides had 60 minute wait times so we queued for 20 minutes for a fastpass for Ratatouille before a rumour came back down the queue that none were left for that day. No obvious signage of such an issue was provided and I had to go to the head of the queue to enquire and get confirmation and this was so. A waste of 20 minutes of our lives.A significant portion of your queuing is done outdoors, so be prepared given the weather. Cold wet bored children do not make good companions.Lastly a curious note on our departure. We traveled as previously stated via Charles de Gaulle Terminal 3. In the caf   shops a bottle of Pepsi was    3.60. In the vending machine, within 20 metres of the shops, it was    2.20.",Disneyland_Paris

We visit the park quite a bit and never tire of it. Parades and shows are amazing. Rides are fun. Matterhorn will beat you up and give you a headache but we have to go on it once no matter what. No matter how hard we try or how fast or early we get to the Pinocchio ride we can never get on it. Line is HUGE!!! Park lets you take food in which is nice and convenient and helps cut costs for families. Park food is pricey but similarly priced to any other amusement park. The meet and greet dinners are a great way to see the characters and enjoy a great meal. I could go on and on about  The Happiest Place on earth .... bottom line.

The entire section by Splash Mountain, the Hungry Bear restaurant, Winnie the Poo and the store are all closed. The Matterhorn in also closed and will be for some tome.

So much to do in this park and even though we have visited a couple of times before we still found some new things to experience.

585184580,4,2018-5,United States,"Arrived at 9 am on a Thursday. Went with my wife and 7 year old son. Getting on rides early in the day is best. Was able to do 4 attractions in Tomorrowland in less than 2 hours. You must use the fastpass to save time, and then go to the non fast pass attractions until it is your designated time for your fastpass ride. The longest wait we had was for the Dumbo ride, a non fastpass attraction. A smartphone app that tells you the wait times for attractions is a must.Another timesaver is using a mobile app to make dining reservations and order food at places you would normally wait in line.After lunchtime, the crowds were heavier. Wall to wall people in some locations, particularly around the entrance to Adventureland and Frontierland. My son finally reached the height minimums for some rides and enjoyed Splash Mountain, Star Tours, and Thunder Mountain Railroad.We stayed in the park until the fireworks ended. Waited 45 min in a non reserved area to watch the fireworks. To get more people out of the park faster, we got to go through the cast member area behind Main Street.If it were possible, I would visit Disneyland in the off season, just so the crowds can be a little thinner.

324835452,5,2015-11,United Kingdom,"I had absolutely no idea what to expect as I haven't been to any disney theme parks in the past. However this exceeded all of mine, and my husband's, expectations (we don't have kids so just went as a couple of big kids!)I'm going to try and answer some of the questions you may have if you are also a Disney virgin:1. You can easily take a rucksack  bag on the rides with you and put it between your legs or in the pouch on the rides. I would recommend a small one for your comfort 2. You could take a decent camera too and put it in either a camera case or in the secure areas in front of your legs on the rides. I think the staff would help you if you were struggling3. There are lockers available to store things4. The park is well set up with lots of shaded areas and walk ways between the different zones, it's not too big and would be fine for little legs5. There are lots of food options with a range of styles   cuisines, it's not great for vegetarians though. There are lots of delicious sweet snacks too6. The staff are all really helpful and kind, they will take photos of you as a family   couple, it feels very safe and secure. Even if you are behaving like an over excited wally they'll just snap away and wish you a magical day7. The toilets are plentiful, clean, have western toilets and plenty of loo roll8. There are buggies for families to hire and these are just left outside the rides with all of the belongings on...It feels that safe. You can take your own pushchair.9. Most of the visitors seem to be from Asia and will spend most of their time on their phones and taking selfies (even if they have kids), the kids don't run wild but aren't as well supervised as they are in England perhaps. 10. There are lots of water fountains   spouts around that people use to refill bottles. We took water in and then refilled as required11. It's easy to get there on the mtr (subway   metro) and this is a really good way to arrive with a 5 minute walk to the park12. You can buy tickets in advance, we went on a Thursday, arrived at 10am and walked straight up to the counter (no queues), we went straight through to the park, the zones don't open until 10.30 so you have to stay on a shopping 'street' until then. I wouldn't recommend arriving too early because of this, but it was nice to look around13. There were two parades on the days that we went, there is always one around 6.30   6.45. They looked great but as 'adults' we weren't too bothered about these and used this time to jump on some of the rides! You could ask about these as they're not well publicised14. There are lots of characters around to meet, some have queues and others don't, these are really well done and great for big and little kids alike!15. Most of the rides we got on within 5 minutes of queueing throughout the day though it's definitely quieter between 10 and 12.30. The two exceptions were the autopia (not worth the wait) and the pooh ride, but you can use a priority ticket on these (everyone is entitled to 2 with standard tickets on certain rides), they tell you when to come back and you go straight in. Even so we queued for 15 mins for pooh (well worth it) and 35 for the other one16. The queues are all in the shade (great for someone like me who burns easily) and there are things to see as you queue. The attention to detail throughout is phenomenal.17. The best rides for us were mystic manor (blooming brilliant) and the runaway mine cars in guzzling gulch, I also loved the space roller coaster18. definitely go mid week if you can. We stayed 6 hours and were pooped afterwards. There is lots to see and do, it was smaller than I expected but utterly delightful.I would definitely recommend this attraction. I hope this helps and you have a fabulous day if you choose to go!",Disneyland_HongKong

You never stop being a child inside. We loved the golden Mickey awards show, the performers were really good. The show is planned in details with fireworks and bubbles coming from the sealing. For children must be amazing. We payed 500 HK$ per person for full day access, which was ok. Some rides were so good we went twice like train thru the mountain.

126944980,5,2012-3,United States,"Ok before I begin let me just say that I am a So Cal resident and an annual pass holder, I dont want my review to feel biased but rather give an informative perspective of what to expect at Disneyland. So here goes..... The parking lot of disneyland is currently closed, you have to park off Harbor and Katella and take the disney shuttle bus to the main disney gate. The shuttles run back to back and you will not have to wait more than 2 minutes to get on the next one. There is a charge for parking, but the parking site is lighted and very secure. Before you get on the shuttle, take note of where you parked, each parking lot has names, like, Buzz, Jessie, Woody, etc.... You will need to know this to get on the right bus on the way back.The bus drops you steps from the main gate, you go through a short purse and baggage check point and then to the ticket booths. Annual passholders go straight to the gate. Ticket prices vary depending on whether you want to visit both Disneyland and California Adventure or just one park. Disneyland and California Adventure are across from each other. So as you enter Disneyland you come to a crowded Main Street, see the picture with shops on either side and a crowd of people going in either direction. At the end of Main Street, you can make a right and go to the Buzz ride, Nemo, Captain EO, Star Wars, etc. If you decide on going left, you`ll get to Tarzan, Pirates, Haunted Mansion etc. If you decide on just going straight, you`ll enter Sleeping Beauty Castle.I dont want to spoil the fun for everyone but, if you plan on just visiting for the day, get there as they open so you can sit on all the rides as the day gets more and more crowded. Busiest times are Spring Break, and Christmas thru New Years.There are a number of restaurants inside Disneyland but prepare to pay Disney prices for the meals. Dont miss the energetic and fun filled parade in the evening and the fireworks show every night (Weather permitting).Enjoy the pictures I've posted and have a wonderful time!",Disneyland_California

I thought we're going to an amusement park, Disneyland is soooo much more then that. The place is magic. I don't even have kids and I enjoyed every second of it. Was running around between rides like a 6 year old. The rides are great, the attention to detail is superb. Staff is great as well. Yes, it can get expensive if you buy toys and such.

Young and old, thrill rider or not, there is something for everyone. The Fantasmic show was incredible that we had to see it twice. You can get a fast pass but get it as soon as you get to the park.

189440438,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Before I start this place is mega and us parents enjoyed it as much as the kids (4 years old and 1). We stayed here 9 13 December and it was the perfect time of the year with the festive decorations. We parked at Ashford International and got the Eurostar to the resort terminal then it was a short bus shuttle to the Hotel Cheyenne where we stayed. Apparently flying can be a nause. These 2 (Cheyenne and Santa Fe) hotels are apparently the 'cheaper' hotels but both are spot on and have their own themes, staff and check in at both seem fast and both hotel complexes have lots of different hotel blocks, so depending which one you are put in depends on how long it takes to walk to the Parks, there is a shuttle bus to the parks but this is for lazy people who don't want to walk the 10 minutes or so to the parks. Basically hit the river at the opposite end of the entrance and turn right towards the parks or left from Santa Fe.Breakfast at our hotel was good, not a lot of choice but lots of what was there, the amount of bread rolls that each hotel goes through must be astronomical. It is obviously continental so cereals, bread, croissants, cheese, ham, preserves, fruit, etc. a lot of people, us including made up some cheese ham rolls for lunch, it saves a bit of cash (food prices to follow) and also you can eat on the go, which is handy. Believe it or not (we couldn't) there is no 'shop' anywhere on the resort, i.e somewhere that sells convenience stuff, water, milk, snacks, baby milk, there is a petrol garage just outside the Santa Fe hotel which sells most of that stuff but I had to jump on the tube to Val d'Europe to get baby powder which was only 1 stop away but a pain none the less. Now the Parks. There are 2 which slightly confused us at first, there is the Main Disneyland Park on the right as you approach and the Disney Studios on the left. Before you even get this far you have to walk through Disney Village which is a strip of restaurants, a couple of bars (inc sports bar), shops and Disney stores, this is conveniently placed as you have to walk through it at least twice day and food prices can vary from a 7 Euro Big Mac meal (on site maccies   gets very busy) to a 3 course buffet at 40 Euros a head, there are a couple of snack bars ( by the sports bar) that do pizzas for 10 bucks which are nice, we done this one night as a cheaper night and maccies one night and decent food for the other 2 nights, you could spend an absolute fortune if you eat at the good places every night.You will obviously create your own itinerary when you get into the park, just make sure you grab a Park Map and show schedule from the main turnstile entrance at either park, you will need them. 4 days is enough time to do everything you want and some things twice if you want to, me and the boy went on the Tower of Terror ride 5 times, its brilliant (its the big Hollywood Hotel on the Studios park, prepare yourself!). Another tip would be to use the Fast pass ticket machines which you can have one of per park ticket per ride, you can be queuing for up to 45 mins for some rides but with the fast pass rides put your ticket in the machine and go back at the allotted time and the queues are tiny. Each night there is a fireworks display on the Main park at the big castle at 1900, it lasts for about half hour and we only went to it twice and it gets mega busy and it was a pain with the pushchair and the crowds, by the time you get out its about 2000 and then most people go and eat so restaurants are chocka, we ate before the fireworks as we had a little one who wanted her bed by this time, so it was back to the hotel for a beer.All in all a great holiday and we will be returning once the eldest is at least 1.4m tall as 2 of the rides he could not go on.",Disneyland_Paris

225420676,5,2014-8,Guernsey,"We visited Disney Paris on 15th August for 4 nights, we are a family of four with a 5 & 3 year old. We were a little worried prior to going as read some negative reviews but once again found the reviews to be wrong! Like any big attraction in August it's going to have negatives but the positive far outweighed these.We stayed at the Sequioa Lodge which was fine, close to Disney, clean and quite which is what you want after long days. The Hunters Grill restaurant was nice, good choice of food and tasty, but very expensive, for 4 soft drinks and four meals it was over 100 euros, but to be honest this is average prices for all the restaurants in Disney. We regret not buying one of the food packages prior to going.We made full use of the magic hours which were on everyday, we booked breakfast for 7 every morning and were in the park for 8am, only a few rides are open and they are all the younger children rides which suited us because we never queued more than 10 mins, these rides were the flying elephants, teacups, peter pan, orbitron, buzz lightyear and the carousel. It was nice having 2 hours without huge crowds because when 10am arrives the park becomes extremely busy. We made sure we got fast passes for the rides we really wanted to go on like thunder mountain and ratatouille as the queues for this got up to 3 hrs long! Get the passes early as they close the machines by lunch time! The parade was fantastic, it starts at 530pm every day but people line the streets at least one hour before which I recommend doing to get a good place for the little ones to see, we found a LOT of adults without kids pushing to the front blocking kids views and this was the same for the fireworks and believe it or not having pictures taken with characters which really annoyed me as our kids waited for a very long time to see captain hook and the bulk of the queue were grown ups, only to then not meet him as his time was up!! So get to the character meetings early if you really want to see them. We found everything very expensive but despite what the rules say we took in our own food and drinks which a lot of people did, there are water fountains everywhere so we kept filling our bottles up and we took some of those Robinsons squashed things with us and turned the water in to juice, they were a godsend, I highly recommend taking them to save pennys on drinks, it is 4 euros for a soft drink so it certainly adds up. All the merchandise is very expensive too but your at Disney so why not treat yourself a bit!This is sounding negative but it's not, we had an amazing time, the looks on the kids faces will stay in my memory forever, all the rides are great fun. The fireworks which are on at 11pm are the best I've ever seen, again get a place early to get a good view, it is well worth it. There is no right or wrong order to do the parks but we spent more time in the main park, the studio one was good, we loved the stunt car show, and the rides are fab, ratatouille is amazing. We also went to the buffalo bill wild west show which was amazing, well worth the money, we just booked the cheap seats and truthfully saw no difference between them and the expensive ones. Food, as I've already said your looking at 100 euros per meal and that's without pudding and only one soft drink each. We ate at hunters grill, which was yummy, the rain forest caf   which is great fun with a thunder storm happening in the middle of your meal, kids loved it, food was nice to. Then one night we just had a mcdonalds which Is on sight and normal prices (well motorway prices) so still a cheap meal! overall a really great place, kids had a blast. Any questions feel free to ask, thanks",Disneyland_Paris

Me and my girlfriend were there in the middle of July 2010 on a MONDAY! The park was open to 11pm and therefor we got plenty of time. But the crowds were huge and i  ve got to have a gameplan of the day. The rankning of the rides. The ranking system is based on the numbers from 0 10 and i  ve just compared it to other disneyrides. Therefore, a 10 in my ranking would probably not be able to match with a 10 in a park like Cedar Point! But here you are!Disneyland park: Phantom Manor: 6Very nice theming, not much scary, but overall a very good ride. Queue time: 10minBig thunder Mountain: 8Family favourite, not that thrilling, but great theme and the best BTM in the world. Queue time: 80minIndiana Jones: 5I have to say that this ride should have been built more like that one in California. This ride hurts and the only thrilling part is the loop. Queue time: 30minPirates of the Caribbean: 8A classic! You can  t miss it if you are going to disneyland. Queue time: 5minPeter Pans flight: 6The best indoor ride for younger children, Huge Queue!!! Queue time: 60minSnowhites scary adventures: 3A bit too scary for children, and very boring to teens and adults.

Just half an hour from Paris we stayed at the marriott village which is fantastic and very close to the park, shopping mall etc. The park itself is just as magical and well run as it's american brother.

My most recent visit was to celebrate my mom's 86th birthday (and her 1st visit). They made her feel like a Queen! We went to the Town Hall to find out about wheelchair access (we rented one for $12 day) since taking on the whole park by foot at age 86 would have been a bit too challenging for her. They were wonderfully helpful with tips for getting the most from our visit . She was given a 1st timers badge AND a Happy Birthday badge to wear for the day. Disneyland staff and park visitors alike were wishing her a happy birthday by name all day long and she loved it.,Disneyland_California

Also if you want to see the parade then find a spot early and stay put as it gets very busy and a lot of pushing! We manage to get to the front and sat on pavement until parade time,, the parade is great. Food is good inside the park but if you want to save time then I would make sandwiches!! If you have buffet breakfast in the hotel then stock up on snacks etc!!You can then eat whilst queuing up for rides it saves on money and time and keeps the kids busy whilst in line..

To spend so much money and not be able to experience most of the things you want to is so disheartening. Our first visit ever to Disneyland for the Christmas holidays and we missed out on so many things, simply because of the amount of people and wait times. If you want to see the fireworks and the snow, you have to be in certain roped off areas that are so packed with people that it is dangerous.

Every ride, attraction, vending stall, shopfront etc was displayed to perfection. Every staff member we dealt with was happy, relaxed and extremely friendly.

We were able to ride several rides before the park got too crowded, so it's worth getting up earlier for. Take advantage of Fastpass to maximize your time spent on rides. As usual for Disney, the park was clean and employees were generally friendly and accommodating. And the queues before the rides were immersive for the story ride. Easily could have spent another day there exploring the park, watching parades shows and riding rides. An 11 on a 1 10 scale! ",Disneyland_California

There are plenty of food options for toddlers. Unfortunately the baby change facilities were quite dirty. Locker hire was very helpful and there is plenty of space to leave strollers whilst standing in line. All in all it was a great day out as expected. ,Disneyland_California

We also had an unpleasant situation where my youngest daughter purchased a candy cane from the store underneath the castle. It was most definitely not strawberry flavour   it was revolting (although it was within use by). The manager refused to do anything about it even when we invited him to taste an untouched (still wrapped) part to see for himself.

467836283,3,2017-3,United States,"We went on a Wednesday and by Disneyland's pricing category, it was a  Regular  day (not a  Peak  day or a  Value ) when crowds were suppose to be moderate. It was very crowded & the ride waiting times were very long. The best part of the entire day was seeing the Electrical Light Parade!!! I saw it a lot as a kid growing up in Southern California and it was just as great! People started saving places to sit and watch 2 hours before the parade started. About    before it started a nice employee found us a place along Main Street. Squeeze in behind the ropes with other people. They're suppose to collapse strollers if they do not have a child in it to make room for people. FYI: the parade starts at Its A Small World and ends at the end of Main Street. We ate dinner at the Plaza Inn on Main Street. They have the best fried chicken dinner (3 pieces plus mashed potatoes & gravy, green beans and a biscuit) for $17.49. The kid's plate is $6.99 for a small fried chicken leg, mashed potatoes & gravy, apple sauce and a small drink. Disneyland implemented going thru security right when you get off the parking structure's escalators. It made it much more efficient and saved time having it there than by the ticket booths. TIP: You can bring in bottled water so you don't have to buy it in the park. TIP: If you burn easily, bring sunscreen with you! We saw a lot of fair skinned people with red shoulders and arms from not protecting themselves from the sun. It was only 83'   warm, but not a hot So Cal day!",Disneyland_California

482158812,5,2017-4,United States,"My overall feel for this Park was that Disney mailed the plans for a Disney Park to the French, and they tried to interpret them the best they could.. and ended up with a weird French feel to it. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad thing. The overall feel is fun, magical, etc... but in many ways it didn't feel like Disney. The layout was sort of confusing: Disney's original idea in California was to build a hub with each land easily accessible. They carries over here, but once you get into those lands, you can easily run into dead ends.Overall, the attractions were equal to those at other Disney Parks. But after hearing all of the wonderful things about Phantom Manor, the place fell flat. The Phantom himself looked like a silver mannequin. Cast members were all terrific (in many ways, friendlier and happier than some in the US Parks).The one HUGE plus was the Illuminations show at the Castle. I came expecting standard fireworks. I was blown away by the video presentation on the Castle. This show alone makes Disney a must see for those visiting Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

Fantasmic    is a MUST See. Spectacular Special effects. Mickey's Imagination gets away from him for a short time, but a great finale.We spent New Year   s Eve at the park. It was a spectacular show broadcast live over TV. BUT boy was it busy.The park hit about 96% Capacity according to their Index, but you would swear it was OVER capacity. People were starting to set up their spots as early as Noon, so that they could be front and center for the show.Whenever there is a show on, whether it   s Fantasmic, or the Fire Works, or even a Parade, it is VERY hard to get around from Land to Land.They have 1 way traffic in and out of each land, and not always the way you want to go.

498693311,5,2017-3,New Zealand,"My friend and I recently spent 2 days in Hong Kong Disneyland (HKD) and we loved it! The whole experience started with taking the train to HKD   really loved the whole Disneyland theme throughout the train, with Mickey Mouse shaped windows and cool golden statues of well loved Disney characters throughout the train. Even the train station carried through the magical theme.Loved the rides   my all time favourite was the  It's a small world  ride where you go on a boat ride through these amazing landscapes filled with singing and dancing dolls dressed in costumes from all over the world. Don't miss the parade of singing dolls that come through the clock face right in front of the ride (I think every hour on the hour). The song does stick in your mind after a while though :)There were so many magical rides, including the Dumbo ride which made you feel like you were flying, and the Mystic Manor ride with some pretty cool special effects. Don't miss the jungle boat ride as well. For the more adventurous people, they also had the more hairy rollercoaster ride, which was fun, with everyone screaming together! :) There was a bit of a wait for some of the more popular rides, but they weren't too long. Make sure you do bring along a bottle of water and a hat (or umbrella) though. I also really loved the Storybook Theatre and the Lion King show. These were like Broadway Musicals with all your well loved Disney friends. Superb shows with lots of singing, dancing and special effects which I really enjoyed. Really enjoyed the daily parade down Main Street, the night time parade as well as the fireworks at the end of the evening!When you get hungry, there were plenty of places to eat. We had special desserts in the shape of Olaf from Frozen and there were Mickey Mouse shaped waffles etc. Not cheap, but guess to be expected.We initially thought 2 days might be a bit much, but I think you do need that extra day to fully enjoy all that HKD had to offer (not to mention that you might want to experience your favourite rides more than once). Also, be aware that some of the parades might not be carried out depending on the weather (e.g. the special nighttime parade was cancelled the 2nd night we were there due to rain).HKD was such an awesome experience that until today, just thinking of our jaunt there still brings a happy smile to my face :) Fantastic experience for both adults and kids alike.",Disneyland_HongKong

We thought there would be more vendors open at this time of year. The food queues are worse. So take in food and drinks if you can. The food tends to be fast food unless you have booked an event.

It took us half the day of our two days to figure out how the fast pass system worked   didn't realize we could go every two hours and thought we had to wait till we used our first one... so didn't get a 2nd fast pass till late in the day...totally wasted. :( They also don't let you get a fast pass for a ride that is closed, even if there's a chance it will reopen...kind of silly as some of the rides DID reopen within an hour   and if you are running around the park trying to get fast passes it's a bit frustrating to not get one and then have the ride reopen right away... so I think they need a better fast pass system.* our lunch reservation was at the exact same time as our two fast passes of the day   so we had to rush our lunch or give up both fast passes. We gave up on one, but made it to the 2nd by running across the park on full stomachs and didn't really get to fully enjoy our lunch ambiance... there should also be a system for this if you MAKE reservations and can't actually avoid this...we tried to change our reservation as soon as we saw our fast pass times, but unfortunately the restaurant was fully booked. Grr.FOOD:* food was crazy expensive   but you kind of need to know that going into any theme park   we embraced this fully on day one.* you can bring your own food in   which is awesome! We embraced THIS fully on day two   stop at the CVS just down the street as they have everything you need that you didn't pack for snacks and lunches...we did a PB&J sandwich day, chips, cookies, fruit, special drinks...so that they felt like they got a treat lunch   they had sandwich containers and disposable bowls & cutlery to do whatever you need at the park and in the hotel* line ups are long for everything here so plan accordingly   maybe have your kids line up for a ride, while you line up for any carry out food   no point having everyone line up for the same thing* reservations really DO matter   we made a reservation for Blue Bayou as a review raved about it (they were right   I recommend it   but $$$$).TICKETS, RIDES & SHOWS:* We got the park hopper pass for two days. All our diehard DL fan friends suggested we get the 3 day pass or the SoCal City Pass, but there were a few things we didn't think we'd want to day, so opted for the 2 day pass. If you really like theme parks, then take them up on one of those suggestions. The 3 day pass might be worth it for the magical mornings (if that's what it's called) that gives you that extra hour at the start of the day before the park opens for others. There was no way my pre teens would have wanted to be up and at the park for 7am so I never really considered it...but that advantage DOES give you fast passes before rides have the chance to close, and gives you 1 hr of way less people so way shorter lines. * The park hopper wasn't worth it for us   only Radiator Springs in the other park was of interest, so read up on the rides with your family before going to see what matters to you. We would have been better off doing one day at Disneyland and one day at Universal Studios from what I can see now based on this experience...but I was trying to  plunk  in one spot so thought the 2 days was better in one location.* We hardly saw a single show as my kids didn't want to sit and wait for any entertainment after lining up for everything all day. They also aren't Disney freaks (I don't mean that disparagingly) who can't wait to see characters, so those shows and costumed staff were lost on us. We gave up our night show fast passes and I cancelled our dinner reservation for day 2 that gave us prioritized seating as I could tell they didn't want to stay for the show (colors one). We were in by 8 9am, and out by 5pm both days.* Space Mountain, followed by Star Tours, made my motion sick 12 yr old child quite sick   so we lost most of the morning to him feeling ill. That was our mistake in not researching the rides. If you have anyone who is squeamish, take your time to look at the parks and figure out what works for you. After that, we bailed on the rides in California Adventure Park (Tower or Terror and Soarin' Over California were deemed not worth it, so that left only Radiator Springs which was closed in the morning   everything else there is for littler kids).* Our favourite ride was by far Splash Mountain. We all liked it so much that we used the Single Rider option a lot to return to this ride and skip a huge part of the line. We didn't get to sit together, but that was okay. Pirates of the Caribbean was also a hit, followed by Indiana Jones.Would I return? Probably not   but mostly because Disney isn't really  us . This was a one time thing for our family. We went to San Diego after a few days here and far preferred our holiday time there at a resort enjoying the pools, ocean and beaches...a bit more reality maybe.",Disneyland_California
386879130,4,2016-4,Philippines,"My family, husband, 10 year old son and I, found the park to being a wonderful experience. My son was amazed of the park and having to have been to Disneyland Paris and the first trip to Asia, he found it very unique. He loved the Space Mountain ride so much that we had to skip the parade show for a second ride. The park wasn't that crowded as we had gone on a Tuesday. So would recommend going on a weekday as I was told, weekends is crazy crowded.It was very convenient to get to the park from Novotel Hotel Citygate as this was just one station away.Although we had so much fun, laughs and a lot of family rides, we had a few rides closed such as the Grizzly Bear ride.However, in all a wonderful experience we had especially for my son.",Disneyland_HongKong

The park is great for all ages as the rides cater to everyone, no matter how old or young. It's always nice and clean and the cast members are always willing to help.Food and drinks can become expensive but if you go with a budget, this shouldn't come as a surprise.",Disneyland_Paris
138383521,3,2012-8,United Arab Emirates,"We went there as a family of 3 in August 2012   and were seriously disappointed. Hordes of people everywhere (later told by multiple sources that these were vacationers from mainland China), waiting times of an hour  for rides, made this a horrible experience. Compared this to 4 glorious days spent in Florida Disneyland 3 years back, and felt that this was a big big let down. The park in itself is also small (can be completed in 1 day or 1.5 days at a stretch) Just do not go when there are vacations in mainland China and you should be fine",Disneyland_HongKong
174079048,3,2013-8,Australia,"If you have been to USA Disney or Universal Studios you would be very disappointed. If not, I believe you only need a one day pass as HK Disneyland is doable in 5 6 hours unless you wanted to stay for the fireworks at the end and of course, depending on queues. Focus seems to be on young children however there are some god rides and lots of eateries. Extremely clean. Make sure you can read the tourist guide map as there are not a lot of signs to the worlds. Souvenirs are reasonably priced and well within a tourists budget.",Disneyland_HongKong
148514798,4,missing,United Kingdom,"I have been lucky enough to have visited this park 5 times now from when it first opened in 1992, the most recent getting back 2 days ago.We visited as a family of 8 for 3 nights and 4 days staying in the newport bay club. I have always had fond memories of this park and can remember walking up main street usa for the first time at 4 years of age. It still is a truly magical place to visit for all ages, it was my wife's first time and she had a great time. She told me that the next time we visit she wants to stay in the disneyland hotel!Im going to bulletpoint the good and bad points:The good:* The park is very easy to access from the Uk. We flew to Cdg airport and caught the Vea coach from terminal 2f. * The park is so well themed and looked stunning at night with its xmas decorations.* Although getting older the attractions are still great fun. The old classics such as thunder mountain, phantom manor, pirates of the carribean and space mountain will always be my favourites.* Some great table service restaurants.* Disney dream show was amazing.The bad:* The park's 20 years old and is showing signs of wear. I say close it for 2 weeks and paint the chipped queue barriers, re do the toilets   its the small things and attention to detail that disney is reknown for. * Some newer attractions in the disneyland park would be nice. It seems that the focus has been on the studios.* If you come during peak season such as we did expect there to be queues exceeding an hour going all the way upto 2 hours for some attractions. The amount of negative reviews on tripadvisor about the queues is a joke. Its the most popular theme park in europe....* Smokers do not stick to the designated smoking areas. I did see a few young groups smoking in queues which is unfair and inconsiderate. Especially as their are young kids about.* It is expensiveTips:Go for at least 3 days to get the most out of the visit. If your going in peak time the extra time will be needed to see everything.If seeing characters is important to you visit cafe mickey or if you have a bigger budget visit inventions in the disneyland paris hotel... Best places to see characters as they come to your table   much better then trying in the parks.Staying in a disney hotel? Get up early and make use of the extra magic hours.Make use of your fast pass tickets early in the day. They run out quickly.Avoid eating at peak times. Eat lunch either before 12 or after 2.30.

498844348,5,2017-5,India,"Getting back into world of kids is always great and that can be truly experienced at the Disneyland at Anaheim. The place is far off from Los Angles and bus No 460 from 7th & Flower street (downtown Los angles) takes about 2 hours to directly reach the Park. Its better to stay in Anaheim and spend at least two days to see the complete Disneyland Park. I would definitely recommend this over Disney California Adventure. Please avoid weekends and long holidays, I went in between the week with no holidays and still every ride the wait was a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour. Recommended to spend a little more and purchase the Front of the Line pass. The experience into the world of Disneyland is too good and People of all ages will enjoy it. If travelling in a large group with family and friends it becomes merrier. There is enough choice of food and eating outlets inside the Park, however the choices for vegetarian  vegan are limited. Make sure to spend two days to enjoy the park in full.",Disneyland_California

But the minute I stepped into the Island Resort, there was an undeniable fact that Disneyland is not just for kids, but also those young in heart. If you are going, one day should be enough especially if visiting on a weekday. Make sure you eat heavy before going and be there as the park opens at 10am. The park closes after the fireworks display at 8pm. Expect that food inside the park is very expensive but good thing, you can bring in your own water, there are drinking fountains everywhere. You can also bring in bread and biscuits but not rice meals, cola products or chips.",Disneyland_HongKong

304016721,5,2015-8,Canada,"They don't call it the happiest place on earth for no reason! We want on an adults only trip and this would be my first visit to the park since I was 11 years old. I was simply blown away by how awesome it was! The park was beautifully decorated for their 60th anniversary and despite it still being high season I found that the lines moved pretty quickly despite the signs saying 30 40 minute wait times for some of the rides. We got to the park early in the morning when it first opened and were able to hit many of the popular rides including Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean with little or no wait at all. As the morning and afternoon progressed the lines got longer, but this was the time to either take in the shows and head back to the hotel and rest for the evening. The evening parade was beautifully done and the fireworks show was just magical, though if you plan taking in these shows, you will want to snag a seat very early (at least an hour or 2 before the parade starts). Patience is the key when visiting the park, get the FastPasses where you can. If you aren't a fan of lines or crowds, plan for an early morning visit or plan an off season visit during the winter. I felt like a kid all over again when I entered the park, it was definitely a magical visit and I can't wait to go back to the park again soon!",Disneyland_California

We would have gone a second day if it were not so expensive.",Disneyland_California
391101386,4,2016-7,Canada,"On a recent trip to Hong Kong we decided to spend the afternoon here. We arrived at 4:30pm and entered the park just as the school groups were leaving for the day. The park was not busy at all. A 3 out of 10 at best. The wait times for Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, Mystic Manor, Hyperspace Mountain and Buzzlightyear were all less than 15 minutes long. The crowds came out for the Disney Paint the Night Parade. It was especially busy by the Plaza Inn, but we moved down to Main Street and found less crowds and a better view of the floats.We made the mistake of purchasing a chicken and pineapple pizza and hot dogs from the Main Street Corner Cafe. They had obviously been sitting under the warming lights for too long and were served as is   which was slightly warmer than room temperature. They were both inedible. We opted for some caramel corn instead   not particularly healthy, but delicious!For those interested in 10th anniversary pins, they are located behind the cash in the Emporium. The lines became very long after the parade and I was surprised that no additional registers were opened at this time. Shoppers would be wise to plan ahead and make their purchases prior to the parade.All in all, Disney fans will enjoy their time at this park. We found Mystic Manor especially charming and loved th creativity of Toy Story Land.",Disneyland_HongKong
425710091,5,2016-10,United States,Everyone knows about Disneyland so I'll just say it was wonderful as always. What was new to us was the Walk in Walts Footsteps Tour. Our tour started at 9:30am which meant we got to enter the park 30 minutes early and get an awesome picture in front of the castle without other people around! We also got to ride 2 rides without waiting in line (Alice in a Wonderland and It's a Small World). The highlight of our tour was visiting the Dream Suite above Pirates. It was filled with Walts touches of magic. Our guide was also really wonderful and you could tell how much she truly enjoyed Disney and it's History. ,Disneyland_California

I like having a wonderful time with my family, all the while being treated like a wanted and appreciated guest at their park. It makes the experience all the more enjoyable every time!

128493886,5,2012-4,Australia,"The park created a good impression from the start. We were carefully queued and staff prevented any queue jumpers. There was no need to prove our  Senior  status, the lass at the ticket counter must have realised we were both ancient. Next was the security check, a very apologetic lady peeked into our hand bag and my belly bag. Saying  Sorry, sorry  over and over again and she had the brightest smile while doing this necessary task.We decided to take the train around the park to get an impression of the place. All very civilised and orderly with staff fussing about and being politely firm with those who wanted to stand on the moving train. We didn't see all that much from the train but it did impress on us just how extensive the place is.Then on to the  Emporium  for the necessary souvenirs, a huge building filled with everything Disney. Most of the stock on display is a  Sample  and when you've made your selection a staff person ducks off and acquires the item from a back room. I actually enjoyed watching them dart here and there and pop up when you thought there was no one around.Through some of the speciality shops featuring high quality glass ware and etched or engraved crystal. About all I could afford was to take a photo. Back on Main Street and past some high standard eateries to  Tomorrow Land .We sampled the flying saucer ride and wandered around watching the 'kids' both young and old marvel at the strange futuristic objects and structures. Buz Lightyear is the iconic figure in this section. While wife was out of sight, a young woman approached me and asked if I'd let her husband take a photo of her and I. No problem, did my best VIP impression and her husband took three or four pictures. Then I was asked to pose with their young son. I really enjoyed my minute or two in the spotlight.We crossed the draw bridge and entered  Fantasy Land . This was an amazing area featuring Dumbo the flying elephant. There was also the Mad Hatter's tea party where we rode in a tea cup. Then we watched in amusement as people and their kids lined up in long queues to have their picture taken with one of the Disney characters. The character Pluto had only a very short queue and Jenny went up to him and received a big hug.While heading for the next section we stopped to watch a 'side show' consisting of a slim black guy who performed unbelievable acts with a diabolo. He threw it a long way into the air and caught it again and at one stage had it run vertically up the rope. finally he got two of them running in different directions on the one rope almost tying himself into knots in the process.Next we wandered into the  Toy Story  where wife braved a ride where a car full of people defies gravity and races inside a vertical track from the 2 o'clock to the 10 o'clock position   almost upside down and hanging there for a second before dashing off in the opposite direction.The  Adventure Land  was very crowded and there was a mob of young Indian men who were very pushy and talked so loudly as to intrude into everything being said by the 'guide'. We evaded them on the climb up into Tarzan's tree house. This is an amazing structure that actually looks like a tree but is completely artificial. The incredible attention to detail had me disbelieving my senses.As we headed back to Main Street with the intention of leaving because our feet were killing us, we discovered that the Grand parade was due to start at 1530, just 20 minutes from now. We decided to stay and are very glad we did. The floats were awesome and the who troop of performers did an incredible job. I'd expected the parade to just march past and was surprised when it stopped a number of times and the performers invited kids onto the street to join them.I know I've used words like 'incredible' and 'amazing' and 'awesome' but they truly describe my reaction. Kids enjoy the place, I just marvel at how it runs and what the creators have achieved.",Disneyland_HongKong

All of the shows have reserved seating now, Fantasmic, Frozen ect. If you were not lucky enough to score a fastpass or pay $$$ for dinner and show reservations you won't have much of a view at all.If you decide to grab a fastpass for a later show, you have to wait 2 hours before you can get another fastpass for any rides.The best thing from this visit, a $12 light up bubble gun.

It was simply awesome. The souvenir shops were great with a fantastic range of halloween gear. I went over our half term and the beginning of the week was far quieter but by the middle of the week the crowds were growing as were the queues.

155959730,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Although things are starting to, literally, look a little faded now, there's still great fun to be had here.Travelling off peak seems to be the best way to beat the queues. Rarely had to wait for more than 20 minutes to get onto a ride and the Fast Pass system is well worth using to cut queuing down even further. It's worth taking your own food and drink as the on site options are very expensive indeed. The 'magic hours' given as part of the Disney hotel deal are a bit 'hit and miss'. Only the rides for the very young children are in operation before 1000, but it does give you an opportunity to join the queue for the Princess Pavillion early if you have a little girl in tow. This is well worth doing as the wait time for this attraction is horrific. Although not really Disney's fault, what lets the Disneyland Park down are some of their guests. It's not uncommon to see adults pushing children away from characters so they can get autographs for themselves. Yes, that's grown men and women shoving children so that *they* can get autographs from someone dressed as a cartoon character. It's truly pathetic and not just a little sad. It's very hard indeed to remain calm when it's one of your kids getting shoved, but the last thing you want to do is ruin an otherwise great holiday by getting angry. There are not many characters walking around the park in general. But when you see the above first hand, it's not hard to see why. The character minders should introduce a 'zero tolerance' policy. Anyone who grabs at a character, shoves a child or gets abusive (in any language) should be ejected from the park and banned for life. Or, at the very least, make it known that characters will not sign autographs for adults.Such a shame that the above needs to be said. But forewarned is forearmed! And we certainly didn't let a small minority of idiots spoil the fun.The Star Tours ride is a must see for fans of the Star Wars series! And Big Thunder Mountain is great for younger thrill seekers too. But do check height restrictions when you're planning. ",Disneyland_Paris

The food was not great and overpriced, but it was to be expected at a theme park. The rides were great, the park was clean, and everyone was friendly. The fast pass option was great and we rode every ride in one day and closed the park down! WAY WAY better than Knotts Berry Farm.",Disneyland_California
642957807,3,2018-12,Singapore,"This place is overrated. Entrance fees are expensive, the queues for rides are very long, the crowd is horrible. Tokyo Disneyland is much better. Btw, Ocean Park is way better!",Disneyland_HongKong
446804623,4,2016-5,Ukraine,"We went there early in the morning, we took a taxi instead of MTR which costed us a bit more. At the entrance they check all bags, and we purchased two tickets and went in, it is not very big, small a bit, wear comfortable shoes, it is mostly more fun for younger children, still interesting for adults. There were a lot of people from China and a few from Hong Kong, some from the States, and Europe. The people from China, kept cutting the lines, a few times I had to say,  Hello, do you not see us standing here? , Another place we were waiting to see a show, and there wasn't any indication of where line started and ended just all people standing everywhere which was really horrible. All the Chinese pushed it was a bit crazy, and foreigners looks at each other like Oh My Gosh and we were all laughing even though we don't know each other. I would not recommend to go during summer, too hot. Choose a cooler season. Wear sun screen if you go during summer, might burn a bit. Food there was delicious, we had a few coffees to cool us off, we went during beginning of May. It is different than the one in USA, or China. Best to go there not during Chinese holidays otherwise, too many people and bad behaviours. You can buy the food there, it is not crazy high prices, and have water since you will be standing in lines to get in. We finished late and we tried to get a taxi, was not simple, we didn't know which taxi's to take and etc, so we asked and people were helpful. Outside the DisneyLand there is a fountain, and a nice picture location. Enjoy DisneyLand",Disneyland_HongKong
191270088,4,2014-1,Mexico,"Disney... let's face it, charges a significant amount for entrance, but its a great day of entertainment. Be sure to check to see what attractions are closed during your intended visit, however, as you may not be able to visit your favourites during times of refurbishment.I have been to Disney both with and without children, and enjoyed it each time, however, if you have very small children ( under 3 years) I would wait until they were a little older and more able to enjoy the experience. Paying a lot to get into Disney only to have your child unhappy, over heated and tired ( or asleep) during the entire time hardly seems a great way to enjoy a family vacation.This park does not compare to the Orlando version. If you've been to Disney World in Florida before coming to Disneyland, prepare for a bit of a let down.",Disneyland_California
116963938,5,2011-1,Australia,"I have an incredible time in disneyland, one thing is for sure the fireworks are a must do. Food in the park is not ideal, its greasy fatty fried food, a better alternative is to go into downtown disney or go to a shopping mall and have food there. Wait times were incredibly short as we went in winter, however the days were warm and we have a great time. We stayed nearby at the holiday inn and suites and took the art to get home, but would always walk to disneyland in the mornings.",Disneyland_California
174579408,5,2013-8,Canada,We actually prefer this park as there is less walking and there is a cozy feel to it.  The lines are not as long as in Florida which makes the day more about fun and less about waiting.,Disneyland_California
391012319,5,2016-7,Hong Kong,"Typical Disney  a theme park that could not disappoint. It has sufficient facilities for the young and the young at heart, and rides for the brave and daring. It is a three language park   Cantonese, Putonghua and English. The Park is very close to the town centre, only about 30 minutes from town centre by rail. It is usually described as a relatively small park, but to be fair, it would still take (at least) two days to cover the place. After all, you would not spend the whole day (from 10 am to 9 pm) playing. You need to spend time to lunch, to dine and above all, to queue. By the way, the fireworks at 9.00 pm is awesome. The above said, probably because of the competition from the recently open Shanghai Disneyland, the place, compared with previous years, was obviously less crowded. The average queuing time was only about 20 minutes. The food and drinks are, be aware, very pricey. ",Disneyland_HongKong
217484499,5,2014-7,United States,Single traveler can have the best time here. You just need to be young at heart whether 21 or 62. Many opportunities for tours and meeting great families just adds to the fun. You never feel like your alone.,Disneyland_California

Each time was different and the same all at once. Lots of things about Disneyland stay the same so it seems familiar and not so overwhelming when you go again. Also things change enough that it never is boring. We plan on going for my 4th time with the kids now that they are 6 and 7. We'll probably go again many times. Love it!",Disneyland_California

658296146,4,2019-2,United States,"Having been to Disney World Magic Kingdom in Florida and had a not so happy time, we decided to give Disneyland Park a shot. The Florida trip was in the middle of the summer so it may not have been the best time to go. We went to Disneyland at the end of February during NH school vacation week. We bought 3 day hopper passes so that we could also enjoy Disney California Adventure.Our first day was on a Monday and the park opened at 9AM. We arrived at the security gates at about 9:15AM and there was already a pretty good size line. Security will check your bags and you need to go through a metal detector. You are allowed to bring in food and drink (within reason). After getting through security, you then need to get into another line to enter the park. The security line is for both parks. We did get into the park and it was only about a 30 minute travel time through security and the front gate. This was on a day when the crowd level website predicted a 7 out of 10. The park was pretty full so we wandered around to get a feel for the park. This was until we got into Tomorrowland and there was no line for the Buzz Light Year ride so we went on that. We went on twice as there was not a line when we came out. We then went right across the way and got on the Star Tours ride. (Star Wars ride). As we kept roaming around the park, the ride times started to get higher and higher. BUt still not as bad as in Florida. We were able to get on most of the rides with less than a 45 minute wait. This included the big rides like Matterhorn, Big Thunder Mountain and the Jungle Cruise, Haunted Mansion and Indian Jones. Overall we had a great day at Disneyland. It appeared that there were not as many disgruntled people in California but this could be due to time of year, temperature. Parking did not seem to be an issue in Disneyland as a lot of people walked into the park or had the bus drop them off out in front. Even though the park is not as big, there are lots of things to do, shopping, dining and the parade to finish off the day is really entertaining. On a side note, it was $15 extra  day to get Fast pass if you wanted it. We did not use it and were able to get on all the rides.",Disneyland_California
227788314,4,2014-9,Ireland,"We had a great day here and the weather was really hot. We packed everything in and saw all of the park. The rides were alot of fun. Tickets cost us    73 each. There was a couple of things I was not happy about considering the entrance fee, my girlfriend wanted to get a photo with Timon and Pumbaa (Lion King) but we were told they are not allowing any more people meet them for today, we should come back tomorrow, even though there was only about six people in the queue anyway and we only had a one day pass. Correct me but you pay    73 to enter Disneyland hoping to meet or get a photo with someone related to Disney and nothing. The only time we saw any other characters after that was in the parade in the evening time. In my opinion these characters should be available for meet and greet all day long, it is Disneyland after all. My other issue is the alot of the restaurants and food stands were shut, and the ones that were open were packed. Surely all these should be open for people. The queues can be long for rides but the restaurant we went to took that to a new level.",Disneyland_Paris
147500916,3,2012-11,Singapore,"1) very small theme park  2) easy to walk around  3) dont have to get the 2 day pass, 1 day is more than sufficient  4) the evening fireworks at 8pm is worth the visit",Disneyland_HongKong
327467775,5,2015-10,United Kingdom,Had a very enjoyable trip to the park. Lots to do and occupy the children. Queuing for pictures was a bit tiresome but there were plenty of characters around the park to thrill the kids. Plenty of different rides for all ages,Disneyland_Paris

Lots of good souvenir with reasonable price.",Disneyland_HongKong
418447429,5,2016-9,Australia,This park is easily managed if you do your research. Know what rides you want to visit before you arrive. An absolute must is use of the Fast Pass ticketing option. We easily covered most of the park in two days with a pre planned idea of 'must do rides'. Some favourites we rode 3 times. The park itself is truly an amazing experience. It had a lovely and friendly atmosphere. ,Disneyland_California
232794357,5,2014-9,Australia,"Love Disneyland, visited on a Tuesday & Thursday. Tuesday wad the best day to go, our longest wait in a queue was 25mins for the submarine ride. Use the fast pass ticket system for popular rides. Also we waited for the parade, it started the opposite end to what we expected   make sure you check out the direction of the parade it will save a lot of standing around. We bought the Southern California Pass which included 3 days Disney, Universal & San Diego Sea World.",Disneyland_California
261248232,4,2014-4,Canada,"Disneyland has always been fun. We've been twice with three young kids and each time it was entertaining and enjoyable. On this past trip, with the kids somewhat older (9, 11, and 13) it was less of an endurance trip and more of an adventure to hit all the big rides.It was crowded, as it was spring break, but with correct usage of fastpass tickets, we were able to get into all rides fairly quickly. The exception was the Radiator Springs Racers. This was a new ride, so the lines to just the FastPass itself were out of control. In any case, all rides were open, the weather was superb and my family enjoyed the trip.",Disneyland_California
408843950,5,2016-8,United States,It started off slow but quickly turned into a great experience with great rides and fun for all ages.Fantasy Land is definitely aimed at younger kids whilst all the other lands have something for everyone.

Also make sure you plan your FastPass as this really makes a big difference and ensures that you can enjoy the whole park.,Disneyland_California

281708389,5,2015-6,United States,"We love Disney parks. We had planned on going to Disneyland Paris during our trip to Paris, and then ruled it out because we had read so many negative reviews. After a couple of days of fighting crowds in Paris, we called an audible and decided to go to Disneyland. We were so glad we did, we loved it. We read a lot of comments about the park being dirty, and we didn't find that to be the case at all. We actually felt it was on par with other DIsney parks, as far as cleanliness. The size of the park is small compared to Disneyland and Disneyworld. We went on a Friday and found the crowds to be smaller than we are accustomed to finding at Disney parks. There do appear to be a lot of rides that are closed (Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain part of the day, and others), I'm not sure if that is normal. Also, the fastpass system isn't great. There aren't a lot of rides that have fastpass, and so we just never really had much of an option to utilize this system. Overall, we had a great day and were so glad we went. It's a beautiful park, and if you like Disney it's really great to see a European version of a Disney Park. ",Disneyland_Paris
200035971,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"Having been to Orlando parks on many occasions I was doubtful as to what I would think of a single park Disney. It was a clear sunny warm Sunday when we went. This is not a roller coaster park but the rides are good and different from Orlando. The park was busy but queues were around 20 30 minutes which is not too bad for a weekend in my view. Although, be prepared to hold your space in queues   you will come across lots of people trying to push past and queue cutting   just block their way and stand firm   it's not aggressive just annoying. Overall I was more impressed than expected. A good day out and the Disney MTR is fun. ",Disneyland_HongKong

639817511,4,2018-12,Canada,"We recommend the hopper passes if you are mobile enough. We maximized the number of adult rides when we used the Max Pass to book fast passes in the other park when we were entering a ride. This gave us time to go on one ride, book another and walk onto a ride without a pass and then walk over to the other park. We checked the line up times online on the APP to ensure we did not waste time lining up. We used our steps to walk between parks instead. By day 4 we were going on our favourite rides for a second and third time. We also found the restrooms were bigger, nicer and newer in CAP. The fireworks were amazing and worth staying for. They start at 9:30 pm sharp and last 10 minutes. Secure a spot with a view of the castle. We feel the front of the line pass at Universal is superior to the Max Fast Pass at Disney but the superior one is at least 10 times more expensive. We found Wednesday to be the best day to get on rides with short or non existent line ups. The Indiana Jones ride fast pass line is not that great compared to other rides. It still takes awhile to get on the ride. The Mexican restaurant was our favourite place to eat lunch   cafeteria style with plenty of seating.",Disneyland_California
176566672,3,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Overall fairly disappointed with the park. Some areas not well kept. eg. on exiting it's a small world the lawned areas had not been cut and full of weeds. ( just an observation) The days we were there the parks felt almost over crowded. In the Studios in particular many of the eating places were closed. There were long queues even for the ladies toilets. In the men's toilets there were at least 6 ladies in front of me in line to use them. Most of the toilets I used were dreadful and not being maintained. ( have seen better standards in porta loos at a pop festival !!We queued for ages even for some of the smallest of rides for the young children 30   40 minfor a 90 second roundabout ride. Most of the larger rides were at least an hour and a half.Even 10 min. after the official opening time there was a 2 hour wait for the tower of terror.We made the most of our time, but it was not the magical experience we had hoped for our two young grand children's first Disney visit. Unlike our first visit with our own daughter to Florida many years ago, which was near perfect and we always remember fondly. We have been back to Florida on 5 occasions and the standards are always high.One final warning, seems if you are carrying anything other than a Disney carrier bag ...beware!at 11o'clock at night, after 13 hours in the park with two young and very tired children. As we were leaving, we were dragged out of the madding crowd just outside the park by security and hauled to one side and being demanded to produce receipts for every item we had purchased in in park. (almost all children's toys) Even the hats our grandsons had on their heads. Much of which we had purchased the day before, with the receipts being back at the hotel.When we asked why with literally thousands and thousands of other people pushing past us at that very moment all rushing to get to their buses and cars, most dressed up in hats and ears and ...... well you get the picture! Why we were pulled over (and this guy was trying to look in our bags as well) We were advised it was because one of our carrier bags was one the we had brought with us and not an official Disney carrier bag!!!!! I am a very patient person but believe me, it would have been well worth the assault charge to deck the brainless jobsworth.When he saw how angry he was making us he backed off.What a way to totally kill what had been a very frustrating day anyway.Disneyland Paris really just do not have it right and are doing the magic of Disney no good at all.",Disneyland_Paris

It was like reliving all my childhood memories the moment I stepped my feet into the theme park. Disneyland is truly the place where a grown up can be unashamedly giddy and smiling all the time watching Mickey and his lovely gangs' entertaining performances.

371062670,1,2016-5,United Arab Emirates,This park is a huge merchandise operation with some dated rides spotted around. We arrived at 10 am for the park opening and the crowds were already huge. There were times when the crowds were so think we were gridlocked. That meant waiting in line for a minimum of 90 minutes even with fast pass. We were there all day and one child only went on four rides and the other went on six. The lines to the rides were one thing but the lines for the restaurants were equally daunting with up to 30 minutes wait for really bad food. Then there were the lines for the characters which were on a schedule. So my kids didn't get a photo with any because we're always too late for the timings. 25% of the rides were under repair and some of them broke down and had to be closed momentarily. The parades were ok but the park needs refurbishing. Save your money and go to the Disney in Florida.,Disneyland_Paris
208116497,4,2013-6,Philippines,"Me and my family went to Hong Kong Disneyland for an overdue vacation. It was an experience of a lifetime. I felt like I was a child again, and I can safely say that I wasn't the only one who did. My brother had a smile that I had never seen for the past God knows how long. My cousins are extremely happy and on top of that, my grandfather was with us and he really enjoyed the trip.Getting there was a breeze, considering that the place where we stayed, Harbour Plaza Metropolis, is right across the Hung Hom MTR station. The commute to DL is part of the experience. The Disney themed train is really cute, it had Mickey Mouse windows, replicas of Disney characters and Mickey Handrails.HKDL resort was everything I imagined it to be. Magical. From the rides, to good food, from the Golden Mickeys show and The Festival of Lion King to the Philar Magic, it was spectacular. I won't be telling stuff bit by bit because it would probably take me 3 entries just to share how wonderful my DL experience was. The highlight for me however, was the  Flights of Fantasy  Parade. We were eating our late lunch (around 3:30) when it started and my cousin Jia hurriedly ran to the main street with me and Timmy. At first i thought only kids will enjoy the parade. But I have to admit I really had fun watching it. Every performer had a really good smile while dancing to a catchy parade song. Considering that majority of the performers were my kababayans, it made me feel proud how good of an entertainer Pinoys are.You should definitely see the fireworks at night!",Disneyland_HongKong

362838512,5,2016-4,United Kingdom,We had a fantastic holiday here. Young or old you can't help but get lost in the magic. I spent a small fortune and walked miles but it was worth it. My only complaint really is the food. Ridiculously expensive for rubbish food. Each restaurant only offered a couple of dishes per menu so it was difficult to find something everyone liked. Only a small gripe but having been to Disneyland in Orlando there's a big difference in the people; staff and guests. The Americans can't do enough to help you and were so cheerful. I find the French quite rude and not as 'in the Disney spirit'. That said I'd definitely come back. ,Disneyland_Paris

430406594,4,2016-9,United States,"We spent 3 days visiting the two California Disney parks and had an absolutely wonderful time. Most of the lines were a manageable length (although some were long). I was thankful that for the most part Disney did a good job of providing shade for their guests while waiting in the lines. A few of the older rides broke down, but they were back up and running in time for us to be able to ride them before leaving the park. My 7 year old daughter says that she liked it all except the ride with the abominable snowman (The Matterhorn. It was pretty rickety.), lol. We also saw the Frozen show, and as another reviewer said, it was very good. I'm so glad we had the opportunity to visit!",Disneyland_California

My best moment in this park is when we in car and start to drive back home. Here is why...1. 80% time is spend in waiting for rides or walking past the crowd.2. They have terrible terrible food quality. Although in past many years they have added many new restaurant types, but the food is just atrocious in taste. It it unhealthy and tasteless.3. Everything is overpriced.4. They are probably best in mass people movement to keep crowd in control, but it is ridiculous that it takes 60 minutes from the moment you part car to get inside the park entrance.Kids love it... but it does not mean they deserve 5stars.",Disneyland_California
659354552,2,2019-3,United States,"I   m sad that Disneyland makes you wait in line for Hours to    plead    your case for why your disabled child should get a disability pass. It   s unfair in a very cruel way. They won   t look at your doctors notes. You have to explain,or beg, why your child, should be allowed a pass, Which I kinda get but at the same time, find it very discriminatory. I don   t think they like they way I looked. He didn   t even listen to me. Said he didn   t understand big words, medical terms mean nothing to him, he is not a doctor. He was beyond rude . He was outright mean. I picked a Disney vacation because they cater to families with disabled children. Or at least I thought they did. We were celebrating my daughters last chemo. Which is great and all, but unfortunately because of 28 MONTHS of intense chemo and the high dose steroids to treat blood cancer she has severe osteonecrosis, which we can   t treat because it requires total joint replacement of her ankles, knees and hips, which is not possible during treatment, so we have to wait until her anc comes back with normal numbers and she is healthy enough to undergo such intense surgery. In about 3 months. Until then she lives in intense pain which is ongoing for over a year.  Osteonecrosis is dead bone. My daughters is extremely severe. It   s an extremely painful condition. But that didn   t qualify her for a pass. But a lady standing next to me, her son didn   t like loud noises, he got a pass. I was mind blown. I didn   t even go seeking this out. A cast member, an employee of Disney told me to go do this. To get a DAS pass after seeing her struggle to stand and wince in pain while meeting tinkerbell . The man assessing whether or not my daughter was disabled enough for a pass looked me dead in the eye and asked me why i brought her to Disneyland if she was sick and in pain. What kind of question in that?? I thought it was Disneyland. The happiest place on earth. She has at least 12 major upcoming surgeries, she has been on treatment for cancer for over two years. Why wouldn   t I bring her to Disneyland? We could have went there for a make a wish trip, but she wished something else. She later expressed her desire to have went to Disney and I took her on my own make a wish, and even though Disneyland is actually quite crappy to disabled people. I still got to see her smile and light up at seeing the parade. The joy on her face was contagious at meeting tinkerbell. All in, I   m glad she got to complete her dream of going to Disneyland. She could only do about 3 hours a day, on a 3 day pass. But it   s whatever. We came and saw. We rode 1 ride a day. We wouldn   t dream of ever going back and for that, I   m thankful.",Disneyland_California

332827724,4,2015-1,Australia,"We have visited this HK Disneyland on several occasions. I would say that it is worth two days' to fully visit. Day one can be for you to scope out what your preferred rides and attractions are, then re visit them on Day two. Maybe wait for the night parade, to get the night feel. Stay at the Hollywood Hotel overnight, which is the cheaper of the two hotels. If you have longer in HK, I would then transfer to another hotel, closer to Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon) or Central (HK Island). If you wish to shop, go for the Kowloon side and the hotels there, which are slightly cheaper than the HK Island hotels, where the CBD is located and which have more business people staying. If you also wish to go to Ocean Park, stay on HK Island, because it is in the south of the Island.",Disneyland_HongKong
157619615,5,2013-4,United States,"We visited Disneyland during the 2nd week of April 2013 with a 5 day park hopper pass. This was during our spring break week, which seemed to be after most other schools had their break, so the park was not very busy (which was good for us!). Most of the rides had a wait time of 10 20 minutes.From our last visit in December 2011, Disneyland itself hasn't changed much. Most of the improvements were made to California Adventures with the addition of  Cars Land  and the new Buena Vista shops. As such, it seemed busier in DCA than in DL. Unfortunately for us, a few of the rides we were waiting in line for broke down (e.g., Autopia, Monorail).Because we were staying at the Grand Californian Hotel we got in 1 hour early with the  Magic Hour  entrance. If you have this option, use it! It will allow you to ride the popular rides without the long wait times. One thing to note, is that not all rides are running during this magic hour. In fact, during our visit to DL only Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, and Main Street was open. In any case, you're inside the park and have already beat the crowd when it turns 9 am and all of the  lands  opened. We were the first people on the Splash Mountain ride and were allowed to ride several times in a row before more people showed up!One final tip: If you wait until just before the park closes (for us, that was at 9 pm), you can probably get on some of the popular rides with no waiting. We did this for the Indiana Jones Ride and the Matterhorn. No waiting, just walked right up!",Disneyland_California
668269058,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"First time at Disneyland Paris and had the most magical time. Loved that there were bigger rides for thrill seekers. Wait times not always accurate which was annoying as you lined up for a 20 minute wait and 45 minutes later still waiting, some rides refused to change wait times. However, there was no monitoring of people cutting the line which added to the wait time. Staff were so wonderful and patient after I hurt my foot which meant it took me longer to get on and off rides. Staff were helpful when rides broke down and provided answers instead of    I don   t know    or    I can   t tell you   . Staff spoke good English and were very kind and helpful. Food was expensive so we took sandwiches the second day we went. Lines for food were residentially long with only one or two people serving. Unfortunately some of our food was cold but the line was too long to take it back so we ate it anyway. Brought a meal deal which included an ice cream however the only option was a nut one which I couldn   t eat with no other option. The fire works were amazing. We were able to sit right in front of the castle which meant we had an amazing view. Can   t wait to visit again.",Disneyland_Paris

214694141,5,2014-7,United States,"We arrived at 8a after spending the extra magic hour at DCA mostly in CarsLand. Between 8a and 11am we walked onto many Disneyland attractions with very little or no wait: Pirates, Indiana Jones, Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, Matterhorn. We got a fastpass for Space Mountain at 1230, had lunch at Blue Bayou at 1250p, then spent the rest of the afternoon at DCA. No crowds on the Monday after 4th of July! We found out late in the day that Season Pass Holders were blocked from visiting the parks on the Monday after the 4th of July, which explained the limited crowding in the afternoon and the absolute empty parks up until lunchtime. There is a limited amount of land so attractions are very close to each other. For example, the exit to the Haunted Mansion is less than 10 yards from the entrance to Splash Mountain. Of course we compared everything to the Florida counterpart and had so much fun doing it. Pirates is far superior at Disneyland. The ride is longer and has two large downhill rides. Indiana Jones doesn't exist in Florida. The same platform is used in Dinosaur in Animal Kingdom, but Indiana Jones is a much better attraction. Space Mountain is very different. In California, the cars are two people wide and there is music pumped into speakers by each guest. In Florida it is single file. The ride in California is much smoother and more enjoyable. The Florida version is quite rough and completely dark. In California, you can see a little bit more. Matterhorn was very rough and I don't think I will go on that one again. So many contrasts compared to Walt Disney World. First, not very many attractions have fast passes and Disneyland is using the paper fast pass system. Second, tickets were not linked to your resort hotel room key. Even before the magic bands were launched late last year, the resort key was also your dining plan key and your park tickets. Disneyland Resort had paper tickets for the theme parks. No fingerprint technology. Just sign the back of your ticket and don't lose it! Dining reservations are 60 days out not 180 days out. And I got the impression that people were getting same day reservations at Blue Bayou. In Florida, that is impossible. The popular dining reservations book up and you can't walk up and expect to get a reservation for later in the same day.",Disneyland_California

559848239,3,2018-1,United States,"I recommend going to Disneyland Paris if you go during the off season so that you do not have the crowds. We went in January and we did not have any real lines to speak of. The only wait time was approximately 15 minutes maximum which is nothing. We were able to go on rides multiple times because we got on and just went right back in line to ride them again without any wait. It felt like we had the park to our selves. I would recommend to buy tickets in advance because the prices are cheapest the earlier you buy them. Prices change the closer you are to the date you plan to go. It is not like the US, over the there the price depends not only on the type of ticket but also how early to buy the ticket to the day you plan to go to the park.",Disneyland_Paris

154525125,5,2013-3,United States,"I have been to Disney World twice, and you need to know that Disneyland is NOT Disney World. Disneyland was the first of it's kind, so it's smaller and less innovative. Disney World improved upon everything that was  wrong  with Disneyland. If you travel to Disneyland, you must know that it's not as large as DW, but other than the size, it's just as magical in my opinion. You could take 2 or 3 days to do all of Disneyland and California Adventure Park. We went over Spring Break in early March, and the lines weren't bad at all. The weather was absolutely perfect and we really had a wonderful time. We took our 4 year old son, and the rides that interested him (mostly in Fantasyland) weren't crowded at all. In fact, we had absolutely zero wait for It's a Small World because we caught it during a parade. If you time things correctly and take advantage of the Fast Pass option, the lines and waits aren't bad at all. Buy a refillable water bottle or park mug and refill during the day at water fountains to keep yourself hydrated for little cost. I'm never disappointed by Disney parks, and this was my 4th trip to one of their parks. The staff always impresses me with their ability to pull you (and your kids) into the magic and make you feel special. The attractions are amazing and beautiful, the park is always clean and tidy, and the people are friendly and helpful.

Firstly the cost of the tickets on the gate is EUR109 per adult, book online and with Attraction Tix and you'll pay   55 per adult   nearly half price!We arrived around 11am on Saturday 24th March and the ques to even get into the park was a nightmare. On man on a horse trying to direct everyone. You were herded towards and entrance and bags were checked before being herded towards either the Disneyland Paris park or Walt Disney Studio park.Once we were finally into the park we decided to try and head towards the back to go on some rides. We made it onto a small boat ride within 15 minutes which we didn't think was too bad. We should have gone next door to the little train ride straight away but we walked to Indian ride where we couldn't go on as little one was one cm too small. By now it was around mid day and after checking the app for wait times   everything was over 45 minutes wait. Some were already 90 minutes. We used the fast pass to get a ticket to return to Hyperspace mountain. We got the ticket around 12.30 and had to return between 3.35   4.05. When we returned we did walk straight on and was on the ride within 10 minutes.Everywhere you went, the lines were huge. To get candy floss we had to line up to purchase a ticket then line up again to collect the candy floss   this took over 30 minutes.The places to eat are all greasy fried food, no where healthy at all. There was also nowhere to fill up your water bottles so you had to line up and pay for a water. In the height of summer this could be very dangerous if you are dehydrated.Big Thunder Mountain was out for most of the day however we saw they were testing it and took a risk by standing in line and thankfully it paid off however we were still queuing for 30  minutes.There is no organisation for the shows and this resulted in a lot of crowding and the kids not being able to see a lot.The biggest issue here is the lack of staff. There was barely anyone around to help.Sadly we were caught up in the issues on Saturday night. We were locked in the restaurant for over three hours with two very scared children. It was disgusting the lack of information being provided and at one point we all had to climb under the tables and shied the children as there was rumours that a gunman was inside. You can not understand how terrifying this is. I have travelled so often and I have never been so scared in my life.I would never return to Disneyland Paris ever again due to everything mentioned in this review.

Once we entered inside     wow Goofy and Minnie were there to welcome us    There are plenty of things  activities in the park which could keep you engaged for a very long time and one is oblivious to the time.

81251072,5,missing,United States,"Loved Disneyland, but I would suggest to the Disney management that it's probably time to shutter Toon Town much like they are doing at Disney World. When it first opened years ago, in the wake of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, it was an interesting novelty and an interesting idea. But now, the trolley doesn't work anymore and serves no purpose. The houses are looking worn and in disrepair. The playgrounds are dangerous with various unsupervised larger children bullying the little ones. Mickey's meet and greet has always been an agonizing bottleneck. The area usually shutters early. Roger Rabbit has always had maintenance headaches. Like California adventure, it has the feeling of being half done...a shadow of what was suppose to be the Hollywood land. Current Disney management has done much to mitigate the harm done to the park during the Pressler era. It's good to have the submarines back, to see the Tiki room preserved, and to have back a great level of service.

The staff is not what you'd expect from an expensive, Disney branded park. Most of them lacking language skills or just being rude. In the best case, totally uninterested in your presence. We stayed at the New York hotel, and found the room to be small, with cigarette marks on the furniture, staind carpet and dirty wall paper. Check in staff didn't speak English.. and WiFi is extra.

The queues were not too bad (even better if you are willing to queue as single riders   more often than not you all get on the same ride)   our longest wait was 40 minutes which is not the longest we have ever waited at a Disneyland. We took our food which saved us a bit but still bought a few snacks along the way and didn't feel ripped off.

No words could adequately describe or capture Disney Paris. From the moment you capture your first glimpse of the castle to the many shows, the rides, the characters, the village you will enter a whole new world where the staleness of the everyday humdrum of life and work is but a distant memory and whatever your age if you allow yourself you will become  young  again will find yourself waving at Minnie and calling out to Mary Poppins and posing with Woody or sailing through the  small world  or screaming on  Thunder Mountain  the list is endless.

330073473,4,2015-11,Malaysia,"It   s been 7 years since I and my husband last went to Hong Kong Disneyland. Still remember that was August month and also a very hot month to visit Disneyland. This time we returned again and it   s the kids    and my sister in law   s family first trip here. So we are travelling in the group of 9 people consist of 2 family     4 adult and 5 kids ( age 2 7 years old). We really were so blessed with great weather during our stay in Hong Kong! The weather was fantastic! Cool breeze, clear blue sky, sunny days! But it will turn very cold during the night time. For my point of view, November month is best month if compare the month of August    hot and humid Through my experience, there are some tips to share: I   d personally recommend exploring HK Disneyland over two days, because you won   t be able to cover all areas thoroughly in a day with the young kids. The kids would like to enjoy everything, go on certain rides again and again, and rest after few hours play. I recommended to stay in Disneyland Hotel if you travel with the young kids. Even we stayed 2 night over Disney Hollywood, we still can   t cover all the park.    Buy your HK Disneyland in advance to prevent queue. It is much cheaper buying Disney ticket outside which you may get free gift or discounted dining voucher through agent  If you are in Malaysia you may buy the ticket through Airlink travel website which is Disneyland authorised agent. I get a very good deal the moment I bought the ticket through this agent     FOC Macau ferry ticket and also buy 1 free 1 dinner voucher. ( value HKD350 per person)    Always check HK Disneyland   s Daily Calendar before you visit the Park, just in case there are some updates and other info ( example some ride might be close early or temporary closed) that you can find out in advance ( through Disney website) before your trip there. Understandable, there are no food and beverage allowed inside Disneyland but when we were there, we   re trying our luck to bring in the clear water and some cookies. The cast member is mindful allowed us to bring some cookies and each person a water bottle inside without a question. Also understandable the food in Disneyland is pricey and it   s ranging about HKD 98 180 depends which set you are choosing and the food taste    . YUCK! Either the rice is uncooked or the chicken is damn cold. We don   t mind pay for the pricey food and thought choose to dine Chinese food is healthier than the western food (burger,fries and fried chicken) but guess we were wrong, eat fried chicken with fries is better and cheaper. Even the small kiosk food is better.  Always visit Disney park during week day (possible from Monday to Thursday). During our first day visit (Thurday) the queue and crowd are manageable but for the 2nd day (Friday) we are surprised with the huge crowd although we reach Disneyland on time (10.00am open). Always plan your day which park to visit and so on. For the first day, we went to Main Street , Fantasyland and Tomorrowland and for the second day, we go the rest of the park. I noticed that Gizzly and the Mystic Point crowd is lesser than the other park. Might be these two park   s ride are more suitable to the older kids and adult.Other than the food issue we had, overall our visit in this Hong Kong Disneyland is enjoyable.Have a great Magical day!",Disneyland_HongKong

409235786,4,2015-9,United States,I'm fortunate as to have spent a day in Disney Land and over three different trips spent 22 days in Disney World. It was great to spend the day at  Euro  Disney. The park reminded us of of Disney World but on a much smaller scale. On our day there were a lot of ride breakdowns. My favorite ride the Aerosmith Rockin Roller Coaster went down twice when we were in line. Even with all the breakdowns we still got on with a special fast pass that the office provided. There were also some rides that were under repair thus purposely closed. Not sure why they would schedule that during summer. In the USA there is no smoking. Not so in France. And the cleanup crew just couldn't handle all the butts. The service is good but just not up to the Disney standard. It's a cultural thing.

We went in February so the weather's bound to be a factor and it rained when we visited the park (we went to the studios on day 2). Not a problem then except that the park isn't really geared up for rain and cold   there's a shortage of seats inside and nowhere really to have a drink and warm up a bit   at least if there was we couldn't find it. There aren't many indoor attractions at all really so maybe a winter visit was a mistake. There were some good rides though especially Thunder Mountain and we found the FastPass thing very useful   get a FastPass ticket from the machine, have a wander for half an hour, then go straight to the front of the queue. As far as ambience goes it all looked a bit, well, out of place. There's barely an essence of Europe in there which is good if you like your American theme parks but it does suggest a lazy facsimile of a Disney template. It lacks some magic and sparkle   there are merchandise shops everywhere and it just didn't work for me. My kids (6 and 3) liked the Studios better.

353988504,4,2016-3,United States,"I'm not going to wax poetic about Disneyland, and it's sister park California Adventure, nor will I bash the parks. My family loves Disneyland. We've probably been there twenty times in the last 14 years, since my boys were old enough to go and enjoy it. It's one of the few places where we can park the car at the hotel and forget about the real world, traffic, bills, politics, etc. for a few days.Even though the parks are amazing and always getting better, in some ways those improvements and the high level of upkeep and attention to detail have ruined the experience. I know Disney is trying to fix the issue of the crowds but the crowds are ruining the parks.First off, Disneyland suffers from the crowds much more than California Adventure. It opened in 1955 and the park isn't built for the crowds it sees today. Bathrooms are generally to small, walkways too narrow and many areas just not accommodating of lines that span 45 120 minutes, not to mention the special events like parades and fireworks they've crammed in.Take Peter Pan. Everyone loves that ride but it's a solid 45 minute wait from opening to closing. The queue is tiny and its full of kids and their parents that don't seem to understand the concept of personal space (but that's another issue). In the morning when the park opens, it's a mad rush to get there and the line often extends out past the castle gates and it never abates.Add in parades, fireworks and shows and at times, the park is near gridlock. Fastpasses help but when you're shoulder to shoulder trying to find your way from one place to another through the maze of ropes and Cast Members with flashlights trying to manage the crowds, who cares? It frustrating and at times maddening.California Adventure still suffers from massive crowds and the special events clogging areas of the park, but it was built to handle more people. The walkways are bigger and it's more spread out. Restaurants have tons of seating. More rides offer single rider access. Sure you have to split up your group but you avoid the long lines, especially for Radiator Springs Racers. Those things help a lot.But anymore, there is no off season. Ten or twelve years ago the parks were downright pleasant on weekdays in the fall and winter, save the Holidays. Now, even weekdays during what used to be the off season are crowded and bustling. I'm amazed Disney keeps the parks as clean and well maintained as they do, but the parks are suffering. Not just the guest experience but the parks themselves. The magic isn't as magical at 45 50 thousand guests in each park. Fighting crowds of rude,  me first  types gets old. The strollers...oh my, the strollers. They're everywhere. And apparently, all those people love to sit on the ground for hours to get the best seats for parades and shows. They lines the streets and walkways from 2 pm until closing some days.We still love the parks and we've honed our skills at getting the most out of a trip. Fastpasses, getting there early, single rider, going at the right times of year, etc. all help but not nearly as much as those things used to. Big crowds are the norm now. All you can do is hope for torrential rains so the locals stay home.I'm not hating on the parks. Just the opposite. I'm hoping Disney will get the message and takes steps to moderate the crowds. The already have, in fact, by limiting annual passes and introducing surge pricing. But the guest experience is suffering. Over the past fourteen years or so, we've seen the parks at their best but that is eroding. I shudder to think what will happen with Star Wars land and some future Marvel land open up.Disneyland is still better than any park you'll find on so many levels but it's suffering. I'd pay more to have the parks back the way they were ten years ago. A lot more. It's a luxury but it seems so pedestrian anymore. Thousands of locals, tens of thousands of families all stuffing the parks to the gills doesn't feel special. The parks need to offer that special, Disney magic again. Too often the magic gets lost in the crowds.",Disneyland_California

Rattattoie ride, Chez Reme, Marie   s shop etc all look beautiful it was a very busy space and clearly a lot of people like hanging out here.

We had a lunch in Cafe des stars and evening meal in Plaza Gardens both of which had great food. The 25th Anniversary Fireworks and projections on the side of the castle were stunning. Seeing both parks so close together makes you realise just how much better some of the styling is in Paris than in Florida it is a real shame that they are trying to retheme things like Hyperspace Mountain as the original moon train element was so much better. It was a shame to see Phantom Manor and Indiana Jones we   re out of action but we are looking forward to coming back later and seeing the work completed.",Disneyland_Paris

If I pay 100.00 plus a day for ticket, and have to stand in long line, listening to bunch of kids who got dropped off at Disneyland like every weekend. And have conversations with bunch of these people. And they also come all the time because they have annual pass. And everyone saving places in line. So lines are long in middle of January. And park stuff closed, and needs updated. And I know the star wars is coming but won't open for 2 years. If never been there, go, if been there last 15 years. Wait. It's same as last time you went. Except a lot more kids running around with no supervision.",Disneyland_California
599421720,5,2018-7,Philippines,"It's so nice HK has specific station that would take you to Disneyland. So hassle free and easy. We arrived there at 11AM. Tip: buy tickets in advance at klook or kkday as it will save your time queueing. Be there weekdays as tourists flock during weekends. We were so happy the weather was so good! Initially we checked the weather one week before and it states that thunderstorms will occur but it turned out sunny! We were able to enjoy almost all the rides, almost but not all. There are still some live shows but I am not really a fan of it. For me, one day is enough as HK's disney is smaller compared to HK Shanghai and Paris, accordingly. If you're visiting during summer, bring gear up comfortable outfits as it is really hot, and wear rubber shoes as it really involves a lot of walking. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Indiana Jones ride first then Thunder Moutain Space Mountain before our fast pass at 9.30. Other people took advantage of meeting disney characters. Then fast passed our next ride .

It became quite bored because the attractions are not really attractive to teens. Before, I could see and take pictures with most of the Disney characters like Princess Aurora, Stitch, Mickey, Donald etc. Now, I only took picture with Chip and Dale and Duffy. Where are the others?? I can't believe that there are picture time! I'm very disappointed!! The most fun attraction is the Grizzly Gulch, it was thrilling and amazing!!

Different: most big rides are not here, but some are (Small World, Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain Railroad   called Grizzly Peak here, Jungle Cruise). They have some others that COULD be in the US, especially the Mystic Manor ride, sort of a cross between Haunted Mansion (ride) and Indiana Jones (motif). After being on the road for a while, it was nice to get a dose of Americana. I took the MTR from Tsim Sha Tsui for HKD$44 and it was easy (Google maps says it takes over an hour, but it was much faster). In August, it's REALLY hot. Indoor A C seating for meals is really crowded, so eat early if you can. Cost for single, 1 day visit is about HKD$470 (after credit card fee).",Disneyland_HongKong

People will just ram into you like you aren't even there. This park like many others like it, bring out the absolute worst in people. We were waiting in line for Pirates for about 45 min and when we started to turn the corner a family of five lead by the father cut in front of me and my family, I reported this to a worker but she just said sorry. Its not worth fighting over but it sure got my blood pressure to rise. We will never go back to Disneyland, it is far from the happiest place on earth.

Public transport was much like Tokyo Disneyland and easily accessible with the MTR system.I chose to attend on a Tuesday since I figured the park would not be too crowded. I showed up a little after opening time and there was a minimal wait for ticketing and security. Most of the rides only had a few minutes' wait. Winnie the Pooh was a popular ride, as well as Mad Hatter's Teacups. I recommend using the FastPasses for if you like a ride. Other than that, the most wait time I saw was twenty minutes.Some visitors might be underwhelmed by the architecture of the park. I actually had a flashback to Disneyland Paris (Main Street is almost the same). However, the castle is not as big as expected, but I still had a wonderful time. The Hong Kong engineers created the park to stimulate a 4D effect which was quite unique (such as smells or wind gusts).I would recommend checking beforehand to see if there are any public holidays because the park can fill up quick   it is not a sprawling attraction like the other Disney parks.

146413443,2,2012-11,United States,"This park is certainly not up to the standards of the Disney resorts I visited in Florida and California (FL as a Child, CA as a child and adult). Disney is a company that prides itself on excellent service, and you don't find it here. Yes, I realize it is Disney, yes, I realize it is Paris, so yes I realize it's going to be expensive. However, what goes on here is over the top, bordering on extortion. Hot water and a Tea Bag (not a good brand, either), well over 3 EUR, Bottle of Diet Coke for 4, Beer for 7? Not to mention the food options and quality are just not there. At other Disney locations you can get a wide array of culinary options, the food choices were limited here and they were expensive. Toilets were not clearly marked. Yes, they give you a map, but when you've got a 5 year old and 2.5 year old who need to go immediately, it's not always conducive to check the map. The restrooms were unsanitary in many cases and baby changing facilities were poor non existent, which I found odd for a park that caters to children. I only found changing facilities in a few men's rooms and it was a cold metal slab, luckily we had a blanket. Smoking is not limited to designated areas like it is at theme parks in the UK and US: Smokers can light up anywhere and they are rather rude about doing so. Even areas where smoking was not supposed to be allowed, such as in queues for rides or shows, the staff did not enforce the smoking ban.

232280695,3,2014-9,United States,"It has been a number of years since my last and only trip to Disneyland and it has been so long ago that when my wife and I visited this time, the admission prices have tripled. Back in 1992 when my family vacationed in California, and essentially visited Disneyland, I believe the price of admission per day per person was under $30.00. This past September it cost over $170.00, for the two of us, just to step into the park without having done anything, stepping into any ride, buying a souvenir nor visiting the other attached    theme    park.The park still has the usual rides, from the Matterhorn to the Space Mountain, that I recall it had back then except maybe for the lines being longer this time around. There were a couple of rides that were closed or non operational for one reason or another but they were so few that it did not impact our visit. In addition to the usual Disney characters (Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, etc.), they also have newer faces from their more recent features (Frozen, Cars, Brave, etc.) roaming around. I was somewhat surprised that on our visit on a Monday, the place was still quite filled with visitors. I guess the park really doesn   t have an off day. For the price of admission, Disneyland does little to separate itself from all the other theme parks offering similar or better attractions.Except for the ticket price, I would recommend Disneyland to those with families and children but would suggest bringing only those old enough to appreciate the park and all its attractions. Again, with the price of admission, length of and duration of wait on the lines for the rides, and, overall, costliness of visiting the place, it was quite hard to really enjoy oneself.

Tickets were very expensive to start with so only bought access to the main Disneyland Park as I had never visited California before. Parking was easy and we got the shuttle bus from the car park to the entrance and underwent security checks. We had home printed tickets and they were taken off us at the gate and we had our photo taken and were given new cards which we were able to link to the Disneyland app so we could reserve fast passes. The park was busy but I wouldn   t say we struggled to get on rides. We could fastpass one at a time so just made our way back to the entrance at that time. The longest we waited was half an hour for big thunder mountain. Food prices in the park were elevated but not as expensive as I thought it would be and paid $11 for chicken and chips with a cup of water. We spent all day at the park and reserved dining in the Downtown Disney for 6.45 just in time for the start of the fireworks. The show was magical and afterwards everybody was efficient in leave the park quickly. The park had a lot of buses on to take the crowds of people back to the car park.

I am an Indiana Jones fan and I was not at all impressed with this ride. Ride the Matterhorn Bobsleds  not found in WDW. It's a jerky ride though, and not intended for tall people as its uncomfortable to get in and out of. Space mountain is different than WDW  almost completely in the dark. Great ride.

536732213,4,2017-10,Australia,"Our recent trip to Hong Kong was another testing the user friendly nature of holiday destinations for people in wheelchairs. And, I am pleased to say that Disneyland Hong Kong really did step up to the mark. On entry the staff (cast members they call themselves) pay attention to those in wheelchairs to make it easier to enter. Security and bag checks on entry provide a higher sense of safety in these troubled times. And, don't forget that when you go through the gate ask for the multiple entry stamp so that if you leave during the day you can come back again on the same day without the cost of another ticket. Also if you decide to come back for a second day it is cheaper to upgrade your one day pass to a two or multi day pass at the gate than to buy another ticket. Like all theme parks Disney land is not cheap, food is of poor quality and very expensive, drinks including bottled water are also very expensive. However, they do have rides that cater for people in wheelchairs. In all our travels we have not experienced this before. The park has a number of rides that have special carriages that allow the wheelchair to be loaded passenger and all onto the ride thus ensuring the whole family can enjoy the ride together. These rides are clearly marked on the theme park maps. Other good things about the park include abundant seating as there is a lot of walking to do and a lot of waiting for the young adults (Children) who are off on the roller coasters, etc. when mum and dad are worn out. The paths are easy to navigate even with the crowds and make the use of wheelchairs both manual and electric much easier. We went during the day and then came back at night to watch the fireworks. A tip here   they turn the lights out at night for the fireworks show which in the crush of people makes this a pick pockets paradise. Keep your valuables secure and wear your bag at the front. I had my back pockets touched a number of times during the show but fortunately had my RFID wallet in my front pocket on a chain secured to my belt. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and recommend the park as a good day out for the family. If you stay at one of the Disney resorts they are only a short shuttle bus ride or 15minute walk from the park.

However,during the day,the Indiana Jones attraction closed due to technical problems, the Pirates of the Caribbean closed with the same argument and Peter Pan was also closed...having been to Florida several times you ask yourself if this is the same Disney company.

This time Ratatouille, the attraction, was closed until 16:30 ( park closes at 6pm), and we took several rides having technical problems in The Twilight zone of terror and then in Nemo...this is an amazing number of technical issues for one day visit.We still saw an issue with the Aerosmith ride, that also closed it.We did see an amazing light show, and nice parade, we had a lot of fun as a family, but never expected both parks under maintenance, and with a policy of refurbishing in the low season pretending everything is the same.By the way the Ratatouille attraction never reopened that day...",Disneyland_Paris

241430687,3,missing,United States,"So this is my review of Disneyland... I am a lifetime California resident and have held annual passes for many years. This is the last. I really enjoy Disney and Disneyland and have for a long time. The park is always a fun place to visit, well, for the most part. I feel though, with all their constant remodeling, they are stripping away the nostalgia and replacing it for more and more profits. My wife and I, for years now, always would go and hang out and have an ice cream at the Gibson Girl Ice Cream Parlor... The one that once had seating and the big elephant statue... Long gone is the elephant, and the seating. They keep tweaking all sorts of stuff, and just not making real improvements. It's sad. Rides get remodeled and they change what made them fun, and they constantly break down. Attractions go away and get replaced with junk. It's a shame. Crowds are getting out of control and they blame annual pass holders for that. Well as they have jacked up prices out of control, it's quite simple how to fix it. First, stop passing off the costs of movie studio purchases (lucas and marvel) to ticket buyers and pass holders. Take a look at the insane price hikes and you will see they line up with those purchases by Disney. Second, stop allowing monthly payments on the cheap passes. Only allow it on the $700 pass, yes, $700 people! That will drive up revenue and drive down volume. Start making reliability improvements to the attractions. Nothing worse than waiting in line to only have the attraction malfunction, come back and repeat again. It's real frustrating. Luckily, I haven't had that happen often, but it has. I hear more people complain about that while there though. If you do visit and want a good meal and great seating for fireworks, go to the Plaza Inn and grab the fried chicken dinner and a seat out on the front patio. Great seats, great food, and a better way to beat the crowds. Plus drinks have refills there, a huge plus. Parking is usually not terrible, but can be a nightmare. My advice, don't follow the lighted signs pushing you away from the parking structure. Those are the crop lots that pack you in and off site. Forget that. All in all, if you have a ton of money to blow, head to DL cuz a day will hit a family of 4 without annual passes for the rough sum of $750 $1000! That's just absurd! ",Disneyland_California
385697619,5,2016-6,South Africa,"I went with two of my friends. All adults (technically) and enjoyed every minute of it. Stayed there from the time the gates opened up to late. A few tips. 1. Wear comfortable shoes, preferably trainers. 2. Apply sunscreen. 3. If you are going to stay for the fireworks, make your way to the parking garage. The view from there is perfect and you will beat the waiting for the shuttles and the traffic. 4. Arrive early, run to get a fastpass for spacemountain. Then make your way to pirates of the carribean, splash mountain and indiana jones. By 12pm you'll have most of the major rides under the belt and just in time for lunch. 5. You can only get one fast pass at a time so get the first one, use it early then get the next. You should be able to get 3 fast passes in a day. ",Disneyland_California

661848179,2,2019-3,United States,"It was cold and a bit rainy so that didn't help especially since I usually go to Orlando to see Mickey. My biggest complaint by far is that most of my favorite rides were closed. I feel so ripped off. They should be selling the tickets at half priced since you get half the rides. It's crazy. Big Thunder Mountain and The Haunted House were closed   you should just shut down Frontier land...nothing else left there. Dumbo was closed, Tea cups were dry! It was just a big waste of money. I am glad I got to see it but it was disappointing to say the least. I hope it improves.",Disneyland_Paris
536297433,4,2016-12,United States,"Disneyland is one of those attractions that is part of the L.A. experience. Whatever age you are, Disneyland can be enjoyed by all. Space Mountain is one of the rides I've come to like the most. When I first visited Disneyland when I was entering third grade, I remember that was my favorite ride, and still is my favorite. There's also Thunder Mountain that I've come to like as well. Service is superb, food served here is actually pretty good though decent at best, and the place is kept clean as a whistle. Overall, it's part of the experience of going to L.A. to come out to Anaheim and go to Disneyland. It's an experience to remember!",Disneyland_California
433055143,4,2016-10,United Kingdom,"We went during the week not in school holidays and it was great. Didnt have to wait for anything just walked straight on and even rode a few things twice. Space Mountain is brilliant, better than the Florida one and the mining train ride is great too. Not many big rides and no water ride which is surprising considering how hot it is. Food is average but you don't go there for its culinary delights. ",Disneyland_HongKong
137594351,4,2012-8,Canada,"We have been to the Disneyworld in Florida, so we decided to give Disneyland Paris a try. First of all, the park in Paris is smaller and more manageable than the park in Florida, so if you have young children they won   t get tired easily. Secondly, if you have already been to any of the other Disney parks, be warned that this park has the same or very similar rides. Lastly, I recommend that you stay not more than 2 nights as this gives you enough time to do everything and even repeat some rides!We decided to stay at one of the Disney hotels (Kyriat) and we were very pleased with it. The hotel food for breakfast was average but our room was nice and the other areas of the hotel were very clean. If you stay at a Disney hotel there are shuttle busses for guests staying at hotels that aren   t inside the parks but still belonging to the Disneyland resort.The park is pretty clean however the washrooms are a bit dirty and they can be smelly. The staff was friendly and informative. There are long lines so I really recommend fast passes for your family as they really do save you some time! Out of all of the rides, my favourites would have to be: Thunder Mountain, Star Tours, Autopia, Buzz Lightyear: Lazer Blast, Pirates of the Caribbean, It   s a Small World and Alice   s Curious Labyrinth. If you have children that want to meet characters from Disney movies, make sure to bring a notebook, a pen and your camera! You can catch several characters throughout the day and you can wait in a line (sometimes extremely short, sometimes extremely long) and take a picture with them! This will be a memory that they will never forget. Also the Disney parade is worth the wait. Parents will be able to rest while their young ones watch as Disney characters wave to them on beautifully decorated floats. This was one of the highlights during our stay! The fireworks are amazing and I really recommend that you stay late to watch those!One of the negative things that I noticed was that some of the rides were lacking the magic of Disney. I think that if they had some parts replaced and some areas painted it would make a difference. Also sometimes the rides were    out of order    and they weren   t fixed the next day or the day after.Overall the Disneyland Paris is a magical memory for the whole family but I would recommend that you come here especially with young children!",Disneyland_Paris

501990738,2,2017-6,United States,"My daughter and I and grandchildren age 14 and 10 visited Disneyland June 2017. It had been a few years since we have been there since we live in Reno, Nevada. The park is run down and hugely overpriced. We paid $52 for 4 hot dogs and 4 sodas in the park. Not many places to take a rest as the benches have all been removed. We were on Alice In Wonderland ride at 10:30 pm the ride broke we were stuck 1 2 hour and were walked out by attendants. The Haunted Mansion ride broke down while we were on it for 1 2 hour. The rides took over an hour each waiting in line and you can only fast pass once every so many hours. The Disney Characters are NO WHERE to be seen. .And when you do they are out only 20 minutes then whisked off and you are told not to bother them. The Electric Light Parade is the only time you catch a glimpse of Mickey Mouse or Cinderella or any of them. The park is run down compared to a few years ago. Many of the rides were broken or broke down while people were on them. We were so disappointed with Disneyland. The gift shops have almost NOTHING that says the actual words DISNEYLAND. A very few t shirts and key chains and that's it! The advertisements all depict the SUMMER OF HEROES what a crock of crap. Nothing there is the Summer of Heroes. The music as you enter the park is not the original Disney theme. It is some sort of Jazz or something and that was so disappointing. As you leave the park at night many homeless living on the streets surrounding the park and you must walk through them. Walt Disney in his own words said he Never wanted Disneyland to get so expensive that normal everyday working class couldn't afford it,, well he certainly would not like the horrible way his park is being taken care of today. Such a shame. It is not longer the Happiest Place on Earth we will never go back there. The plants and rides were really run down.. Very sad.",Disneyland_California
207765149,2,2014-5,Australia,My family went here on early May and nearly half of the rides were closed for routine maintenance getting ready for the summer season.

519981405,5,2017-8,Canada,"My husband tells me I am a Disney aholic. My first visit was in 2005 with him, our 2 year old and 7 months pregnant with another. So many people tell you not to go with young kids as it's not worth the cost, they won't remember it, etc. Don't listen to these people. I LOVED it. It is unlike anything I'd experienced before. The sights, the sounds, the smells. Fast forward 12 years with another trip to Disneyland and 3 trips to Disney World under our belts and we were back at the original Disney park this summer. Disney really has something for every age. Every time we go, our kids get something a little different out of a visit. They are now too 'cool' to meet the characters although our encounter with Chewbacca in DCA was awesome! I've always had a soft spot for Disneyland over DW believing that it's the original park and everything is just that little bit better, cleaner, more detailed, authentic but this last visit has me re thinking this. We had some disappointments this trip. First it was really hot. Not Disney's fault but I won't return in the summer again. It just made moving through the crowds less magical and more difficult. We utilized Fastpass through the kiosks and not the Maxpass app as I felt $50 per day for us was out of line. Over our 5 day park hopper passes, we did almost everything. We experienced numerous ride breakdowns! This was new for me. Mr Toad, Alice, Indiana Jones, Little Mermaid & Grizzly River Run in DCA. We also had a FP for Fantasmic, was seated in a nice spot and it was cancelled. Fireworks were cancelled on 2 of our nights. When we got a spot again for Fantasmic   they didn't bring out the dragon. That was a let down. I kept positive to not let these things ruin a trip but it does have me wondering if Disney is sliding a bit. Why so many breakdowns? I still love Disneyland and will go back in a few more years. Probably once Star Wars land is open. It really is a wonderful park with attractions for everyone. It's a must do!",Disneyland_California

23409217,5,missing,United States,"Iv just come back from spending new year at Disney Land Paris, staying at the Santa Fa hotel.Firstly I would just like to say how beautiful the castle looked, iv never seen anything like it and it defiantly made my day!Disney Village is a row of shops and restaurants between the parks and hotels. This is worth a visit for souvenirs and dinning out. Whilst there we went to the Wild West Buffalo Bills show, which i can not recommend enough. It was a fantastic show, the food was good and i can not praise the staff enough. A lot of thought has been put into it, and a trip to Disney land would be a waste without going to see this show. It does say that it   s not recommended for asthmatics, and being an asthmatic myself i did not have any problems. We choose to dine at King Ludwig   s castle which was value for money, apart from the size of the meal was on the small side and drinks were expensive. I was very pleased with my overall experience of the Disney park it   s self. It always seemed very clean; i don   t remember seeing one piece of litter (unlike our English amusement parks). They   ve put a lot of effort in the main street which consists of shops and food outlets. Whilst in the park I didn   t spend much time in queues compared to what i was expecting due to it being such a busy time of year. I would recommend using the fast pass service which is available for all Disney visitors; it cuts out so much time!Haunted Manor was a fairly good ride, not very scary but they have made an effort with it. My favourite part being the head statues that seem to talk and the holograms of ghosts and ghouls. Indiana Jones Temple of doom was very good but once again not very scary. Pireates of the Caribbean ride was very good, and liked all the detail they had put into the ride. Also got to meet Jack Sparrow just near this ride, who was a very good impersonator of the real one. Peter pan ride and Pinocchio ride were alright although a bit basic, but then these are rides for children. Its a small world ride was very good and impressed with all the different figures from around the world... really did get the sense that its a small world after all! Space Mountain mission 2 was very fast and defiantly liked all the lighting effects at the end, but found it bashed me about a bit to much, giving me a headache for the rest of the day. Star tours was very impressive. They have put a lot of effort into the different figures whilst you queue up such as C3P0 and R2D2. Honey I shrunk the audience was defiantly worth a visit and was amazed at the effects used with the cinema. Overall i was very pleased with my day in the Disney Park and would defiantly go back again.We also saw Cinderella and prince charming on our travels. We spent new year   s eve in the Blue Lagoon restaurant which is based next to the pirates of the Caribbean ride. We had an 8 course meal which was fantastic although it wouldnt have been to everyone   s taste. They had different types of entertainment to keep you amused to. Would recommend the fantaillsion parade, where all the loved Disney charters are on floats lighted up.I must say that i preferred the Walt Disney studios. I thought the stitch live was fantastic and was gob smacked when stitched started to talk to the people in the audience (it really is live). Both the Animagic and Cinemagic were very good and well worth a visit. I was amazed at the car stunt show, very impressed with all the stunts and once again recommend watching this! Was a bit disappointed with the Nemo ride, considering we queued for 2 hours.... they could have done a lot better i think. The Hollywood tower of terror was defiantly the scariest ride at Disney Land, and it doesn   t help being able to see over the park just before the lift drops you to the ground!Sorry for the long review, but really didn   t want to leave anything out. To conclude any person aged 1 to 99 will find some magic at Disney land and well worth a trip!!",Disneyland_Paris

548418111,4,2017-12,United Kingdom,"First visit to Disneyland Paris. Overall was very happy. We stayed on site at Newport bay club which helped due to the magic hour(s) you get before park properly opens to all. Key tip would be to use the app on your phone to manage where you go with real time waiting times. The reality is you just have to accept queues. We were lucky quite often and many times the queues were sub 10mins. The parades were all good, but get to your spot in plenty of time for a good view. The castle is great and our favourite ride was a small world (we had fond memories of the same ride in Disneyland California) Biggest issue really is the food. You almost have to plan on not trying to get a hot meal while there. Many restaurants were closed for refurbishing and the queues everywhere else were just massive. Disney   would it be so bad just to have a few pop concessions selling tea coffee soup pizza by the slice? Just little huts vans scattered everywhere to help people get something quick & easy.Otherwise, the magic is there, the shopping & merchandise experiences will permeate even the toughest resistance eventually. Just go with the flow and don't try to do everything!",Disneyland_Paris
529263879,5,2017-9,United States,"It's so hard to say something that hasn't been said before but I will give it a try. Arthritis has taken over my body so I made the great decision to rent a scooter. Be prepared for excited walkers to cut you off, oblivious of your presence but if you can handle the crowd it's $50.00 well spent. My Grand kids walked 9 miles each day before their phones died and they lost track. That said, remember to take your chargers and sun screen. A huge surprise was to be able to take our own lunch. That saved us a lot of money. My scooter basket carried a lot of incidentals but the 3 year olds combo back pack roller suitcase was used constantly for diapers, etc. It also fit into the scooter.I couldn't get over how clean everything is kept and the amazing change in everything as the sun went down and the magical lighting came on.One more advantage to the scooter was many rides had special lines for handicap. I was able to transfer to walking easily so could get on the rides easily. My family was allowed to get in my line with me so we effectively had fast passes to everything.A lesson we learned the hard way is many events throughout the year changes the parks hours. A huge Halloween party was scheduled the first night we were there and we were told at 4:00 certain areas of the park were closed to us and we had to leave by 6:00. The park normally closes at 10pm. We lost 4 hours. We entered on a City Pass which I would definitely do again but remember to check for any special events so this doesn't happen to you.All in all we loved every moment of our visit and can't wait to go back. Take lots and lots of money. You'll need it.",Disneyland_California
405437197,5,2016-8,Canada,It was hot and crowded and many rides broke down but we still had fun.  I suggest more fast pass rides in Fantasy Land as small kids just can't wait that long .  The new space mountain was a hit.,Disneyland_California
285651778,2,2015-7,Australia,"The only positive I have to say about Disneyland California is that the night show and fireworks show are absolutely amazing. Staff are rude and unorganised. Found our place for the night show and sat for 3 hours behind the rope, 15 minutes before show starts a rude female staff member tells us that this is a area for wheelchairs only, would have been nice to be told hours before the start of the show as there was other staff walking around who had not even approached up prior to this point. Perhaps organise the wheelchair area prior to 15 minutes before show time and perhaps don't demand people to move but explain in a nice manner. Maybe staff need to do some training in customer relations. Very disappointed considering this was the diamond anniversary and our family was so excited travelling half way across the world to be here only to have our experience ruined by rude staff. Meant to be the happiest place on earth, not in my opinion and we certainly will not be back.",Disneyland_California
184088153,4,2013-10,New Zealand,"This was a wonderful time for our family but I can't help think it was time of year we went. I read a lot of reviews about Disneyland and while some were helpful not all were things I experienced.We went the 1st week of October and the longest we queued for a ride was 20 mins. It was brilliant; for Kiwis and Aussies it seems the best time to go as the US holidays are finished by then. Once we arrived in the park we noticed how everything was so clean and meticulously planned. It really added to the experience. Our kids had a ball, from Space Mountain to Splash Mountain to meeting Pluto or Goofy. It's Magic. Making sure you get Fastpasses as these do help especially if you have Hopper Pass. Most of Fastpass locations are at the rides but ones like,  Cars Ride  are located within Cars land but not at the actual ride. (Disney California Adventure Park)My favourite rides were Indiana Jones and Space Mountain but there are rides for all ages. We ate inside Disneyland because you walk and walk so the last thing you want to do is walk to find lunch outside the park. The prices aren't too bad but it's funny getting a corn dog and chips. What you actually get is a corn dog and potato chips, not hot chips. There is lots of places to eat so all budgets are catered for. We had a great time at both parks and while we had Southern California City Pass, we did the parks in two days. We came back for a third day but only stayed for half a day. Don't be too worried if you can't afford Magic Morning pass as it's not worth it in my opinion. Only some of the rides are open and only one park is open, it gets real busy until general admission at 10am. If you have older kids they'll enjoy Disney California Adventure Park more. Make sure you do the,    World of Colour Show  it's really well done. However it's all a Wonderful experience and whiles some planning is important to have a great time. Just enjoy and be amazed.

My 7 year old daughter was really happy and my husband was very skeptical. I was just intrigued by the idea of going there and seen if it was actually the same as in California. Wow, was I in for a surprised. Disney was still the same, but just there in between the lines I could see the wonderfulness of the warmth and good service that makes Hong Kong a wonderful place to visit. They have less rides than the one in Anaheim, but everything else feels more relaxed. Yes, that it what makes the difference. The restaurants are really nice and we were able to get a wonderful authentic asian style dinner. I think I could go on an on in regards to our visit, but what sums it all up was when my daughter said and I quote  Look at that child mom, he isn't eating a churro....he is eating fried fish balls  I knew then that I was in for a treat.",Disneyland_HongKong

Too many rides   choose and pick the ones that you want to do. We missed a few good ones due to heavy rush. Visiting on non public Holiday is very strongly recommended. Reaching there   just take the MTR.Food   be aware that there are very limited non HK food cuisine available inside the park. If possible, pack your own food snacks. It's a big park   lot of walk and therefore, quite tiring. Water is easily available. Disney Parade was interesting. Quite a Show! The Fireworks were just about okay.We didn't stay at the Disneyland Hotel inside the park   which most of the Indian families do :). But we didn't find the time on our hands too short. It is easily doable in 1 full day   9:00AM till 9:00PM   at an easy pace.

Managed to do the both parks in one day, (but in hyper mode.) wait time wasn   t too bad, as we timed everything just right. (if you wait a little longer for lunch and go on ride during lunch hour, you find it quicker to get on the popular rides.) We travelled with Edwards coaches, and it took us 14 hours to get to Disneyland Paris. After a little rest and nap at our hotel, Sequoia Lodge, we headed out at 7, to walk to the park, which is only a 5 10 min walk from most of the hotels, through the village and security. We had a two day hopper ticket and made great use of both parks. I highly recommend Rockin    Rollercoaster, Thunder Mountain and Hyperspace Mountain too! Even though they still scare me, thrill me and make me scream until I lose my voice! They are amazing, and I always leave smiling! I also recommend rides like, Peter Pan and Phantom Manor! The artistry that go into those rides are mind blowing    take time to appreciate that! All over both parks there are some great examples of Art and Technical amazement! Sound enhancements at certain stores, like the dentist on Mainstreet, where you feel like you   re part of Mainstreet   s story. Such simple details that make Disneyland Paris, my Go to holiday    and always something new! A lot of the rides were having problems whilst we were there, which was a shame, but after we went on a few other rides they were back up and running! Never get annoyed at the staff, ( a lot of people tend to.) It   s never their fault, and they always try and get things done quickly.. we had a fast pass for Hyperspace mountain and it broke down    the lady told us to come back later, (whatever time.) and our fast pass would still be valid    there   s always a way around things. We ended up going on most rides! And with the extra magic hours! (reserved for Disney Hotel Guests.) you do get a special glimpse of the parks first    It   s a great time to get pictures, go on the smaller rides, and just be able to roam around! We had a magical and great trip! I will say, with coach travel from South Wales, can take 14 hours, it   s a long trip    but seeing it from a coach can be great! The views you see travelling to Disney are a glimpse into France. Try to take it easy your first night, because we did a 14 hour journey and then an 18 hour day in the parks the next day   . So brace yourself! The parade was so cute! The new floats were so quirky! Peter   s flying Pirate ship was a crowd fave! All over, great experience! All ages, All Dreamers   .

Don't forget to go to build a bear this store is packed with all sort of bears you just choose which one then pick a outfit and they stuff it and dress it there it is so cool my daughter picked a rainbow bear and dressed it in a kung fu outfit .They also have so many different types of places to eat and really yummy sweet shops we even watched through one of the store windows people hand rolling candy cane so cool.I suggest you get some fast passes for the rides and shows they save you time so you don't have to stand in line you just show your fast pass they give you a ticket to let you know when to come back usually around 20 minutes then when you come back you just go straight in.I also loved the street parades great for the avid photographer make sure you get there early to get a good spot have plenty of water maybe some munchies for the kids because I noticed a lot got very bored till the parade started coming through.but the best part of Disneyland to me was the world of colour you have to make sure you get good tickets so your right at the front it is a sight you will never forget it took my breath away it is all done with water music fire colour and disney characters Disneyland really went all out with this please don't miss it it's a must see and second to me being the best is the fire works so many ooohs and ahhhs heard when watching this show the fire works were so beautiful and the way they surround the Castle and how they changed the colour of the castle as the fire works danced around it was just stunning so yes if your going to Disneyland you are going to have a ball I don't care how old you are and may I suggest if it is winter take a scarf and jacket because it got pretty cold when we were there which was December.Have a Magical Time.,Disneyland_California

159908090,3,2013-4,United States,"So, I grew up in SoCal with Disneyland as my backyard playground and have always loved it. I have many Disneyland obsessed friends and while I was in Paris in April, I decided to take one for the team (plus I got in free)! While it is part of Disneyland themed parks, it is distinctly French. I absolutely loved their Pirates of Caribbean and the Indiana Jones (my fave at Disneyland) ride in France is so different being a loop d loop roller coaster but I liked it. We went on a weekday and it rained off and on throughout the day so the lines were super short  5 10 minutes. The food that I had was the worst 12euro burger I've ever had (the equivalent of $1 Burger King or McDonalds burger) but they don't have lockers or allow food so you're stuck unless you leave and come back. The park was a good visit and a must if you fall into the Disneyland obsessed category, otherwise France has soooo many things to see that I wouldn't put it that highly on my list of must see places.",Disneyland_Paris

639803595,5,2018-12,Australia,Just like walking into a story book weVisited when the park was at half capacity and really did not wait for any length of time for attractions although grab a spot early to get a good look at the Main Street parade and fireworks are well worth the wait in the evening .... if you have teens that like rides then be sure to grab a fast pass for the rocky mountineer railroad rollercoaster and space mountain although food inside the park is a bit pricey my advice would be to hop on the free monorail at Frontierland it will drop you off at downtown just outside both parks where you have lots of affordable options for dining especially with kids .. just be prepared for lots of crowds inside the park it   s inevitable plan out your day and fit in as much as you can .,Disneyland_California

Throughout our visit, NOT A SINGLE cast member wished me a Happy Birthday (I was quite hurt). The cast members all looked like they've been owed their wages and did not look like they were working at the most magical place on earth. It wasn't even a particularly busy day because it had rained in the morning, so we could only go in at almost noon ish. The only up side was the queues were relatively short, but that's about it. Don't think it's worth spending close to a $100 (SGD) here. Will probably be my last visit. I'd rather save more money and go to Tokyo Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong

We could of done with another half day but was happy with what we managed to complete with 2 young children. Park was very clean and well maintained and the Main St had the same feel as the one in Magic Kingdom in Florida.

268164424,4,2015-4,United States,"With 15 Disney World trips in 5 years under my belt, I consider myself a Disney snob, as does everyone who knows me. I recently had the chance to go back to Hong Kong and obviously HK Disneyland was at the top of my itinerary. My first international Disney! A momentous occasion. I'd heard many accounts about how it is a half day park but I knew I'd need more time to be able to appreciate all the details as well as get in some repeats. Soo, my sister and I decided to purchase two day tickets.We ran in there, highly anticipating our first glimpse of Sleeping Beauty castle but instead, stopped short when we saw what was ahead. A boxy, silly looking refurb facade. Sigh. It was the most unmagical moment ever. Alas..The park was fairly empty until noon time. It was so weird to have the whole place to ourselves. It was also so weird to actually need to use a guide map! But we got so much done! Let's see...rides? My favorite was definitely Mystic Manor. In fact, I'd put it in my top 3 favorite Disney rides of all time. The ride is so technologically advanced and the theming details were all incredible. I also really enjoyed Space Mountain and Runaway Mine Cars. The Space Mountain here is a much smoother ride than the one at WDW. The Runaway Mine Cars was pretty thrilling too. Similar to Big Thunder Railroad in WDW but longer. Faster. With a twist!As for the shows? The Golden Mickey's was spectacular and I couldn't take my eyes off of the stage. The cast was wonderful and Bebe, the lead, was such a doll. Her voice gave me chills. As did Rafiki's from Festival of the Lion King. The show here is very different than the one at WDW, not as interactive, but more of a play by play. I enjoyed this very much though. My sister and I both felt that these shows were under appreciated though. The audience for both was so stoic and didn't seem to be having a good time. Cultural difference? I don't know. This kind of took away from the whole experience, especially when the cast is asking everyone to clap but get them from just from my sister and I and a select few others. Meh.The parades were DELIGHTFUL. I preferred the evening Paint the Night parade for sure    the colorful lights and catchy song made for an explosive audiovisual experience with all your favorite characters at the forefront. Disney does it best. Food    mostly asian options of course but quite a variety    Indian, Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, etc. Starliner Diner offered burgers and such too if you prefer. My sister and I had solid meals at Tahitian Terrace and Explorer's Club. We also decided to try as many HKDL specific snacks as we could stomach    curry popcorn, chocolate black sesame ice cream bars and korean dried squid. All were YUM. The fireworks were great but would have been so much better if not held behind the backdrop of a big ol' box. Arggh. The castle refurb was seriously such a letdown although honestly the only one. Some differences to WDW    It was definitely very different hearing the characters speak in Cantonese and Mandarin but it was cute. Park crowds were pretty light on both days. Instead of pins, everyone seems to collect stickers here. The cast members with the red pouches have them, fyi! Umm, the attention to detail between lands is a little lackluster. There was a lot of open blank spaces. Eeh. The cast members also don't look as happy. In the grand scheme of things, there is no comparison to WDW but HKDL still has it's own charm.Overall, I had an incredible time! 2 Disney's down, 3 more until I hit the ultimate achievement!",Disneyland_HongKong

The lines were shorter than Disney World and that is a huge plus! We had heard that the cast members aren't as friendly and the only place I saw why this may be said is at restaurants because the theming isn't integrated as much with characters as it is at Disney World.

17865759,1,missing,United Kingdom,"I really don't see what all the fuss is about,I cannot belive all these reviews saying how fantastic this place is. I can only imagine they are putting something in the overpriced food and drinks.I went with my family in April and found it dreadful.We had tickets as part of a pack but when we got to the end of the line we were rudely sent back to the ticket purchase booth to change the voucher into a ticket.There were very long queues for everything but you could put your ticket in a machine that gave you a slot later in the day   everyone we tried gave a time 6 hours ahead !.My daughter wanted to see 'Captain Jack Sparrow' who was there but we were turned away just before we got to the end of the line 'as her had to go on his lunch break'. Now don't get me wrong but it wasn't Johnnie Depp, with the prices that Disney are charging couldn't they have two !All the staff gave a very bored fixed smile but at the end of the day treated everybody with distain and 'guests' were just pushed along without any sincerity.Numerous rides were not working or temporarily out of order.Going back to California next year and will definately be avoiding this place.Recommend San Diego Animal Park, San Diego Zoo or Universal Studios instead !",Disneyland_California
146865308,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,"Before I went to Disneyland Paris I looked at the reviews on tripadvisor was a little bit concerned when I was seeing reviews along the lines of '...needs a revamp...' and '...not all it's made out to be...' thinking is it all going to be a bit of a let down?Well the answer was NO.I thought I'd write this review so that other families that were looking at reviews of Disneyland Paris would not be concerned by the negative or not so good comments that have been left.We stayed in the Sante Fe Hotel which is a short 2 minute bus ride to the park. The hotel itself is nothing special, but it's very warm and has the facilities that you need. We had a problem with changing the code on the safe and unfortunately I locked it which meant a trip to reception to ask for help. I could tell the lady at reception was laughing at me for being such a muppet even though she was speaking french but nonetheless we had someone at the room by the time I got back and was very helpful in sorting the safe out and 5 minutes later I had the safe sorted. After that we had some snacks and got an early night ready for the next day at the park.The next morning (Monday) we went across to La Cantina where a continental buffet breakfast is served. Theres nothing hot available, which wouldn't have gone a miss in such cold weather, but theres plenty of cereal, toast, criossants, cheeses, ham, juice, tea, coffee etc fill you up to start the day. We had an early breakfast at 7 7.30 but you can change it for a different time however it's already pretty busy at that early hour and going at that time meant we was in the park for just after 8 to make full use of our extra magic hours.Disneyland Park itself is pretty special even first thing on a dark and cold morning. We went up to the It's a Small World ride first off and it was a nice ice breaker to the magic. Only part of the park is open before 10am so we had to wait for Frontierland and Adventure Land to open but you can still burn a couple of hours before these open in the other parts of the park and it's always nice to look around the gift shops too. Once the other parts of the park opened it started to fill up a bit. But we still queued for no more than 20 minutes for Big Thunder Mountain. We walked straight onto the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril ride   which was one of our favourites, the Pirates of the Carribean ride is not really that thrilling to be honest but it's still quite fun looking at the pirates and the scenes and theres a couple of splashes which adds to it. We had food in Discoveryland then while watching a brass band with Mickey Mouse as the conductor. Space Mountain was closed while we were there but it didn't spoil the day at all as theres so many other things to do.In the afternoon we went over to the Walt Disney Studios Park which is all about the Disney movies. We went on Crush's Coaster which is one of the best rides in Disney. We saw Chip and Dale over there too wandering about in santa hats which only adds to the atmosphere. We wanted to see the Lilo and Stitch show but we just missed the english version so we left that until the next day. After wandering about we went to the Disney Village to see what it was all about. Theres a lot of shops including a McDonalds and a Starbucks and also a Planet Hollywood, which gave us a good 45 minutes before heading back to Disneyland Park to see the lighting of the Christmas tree and the Disney Dreams show.If you go at Christmas and want to see the lighting of the tree its best to get there early so you can get a good spot to see the Disney Characters. Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Donald Duck arrive on a giant sleigh and have a good dance to some music before picking a child from the crowd (pre chosen we think) to light the tree with the magic wand. They give the child a hat and a gown to wear and then bit by bit the tree lights up until it reaches the top and the star is lit and snow starts to fall over you. It was possibly one of the most beautifully festive things we have ever seen. At this point the place is packed with people so you have to be careful when manouvering towards the castle but make your way over straight away so you can see the Disney Dreams show, which marks the 20th anninversary of Disneyland Paris.The Disney Dreams show is something else. The castle is lit up prior to a story is projected onto the castle itself where Peter Pan's shadow knocked the magic out of the star on top of the castle. The story goes through a catalogue of Disney's greatest movies and characters with Peter Pan's shadow flying about during which fireworks are going off and giant flames and are so big we could actually feel the heat where we were standing. The story is also projected onto the spray from the fountains which is a really clever touch. Trying to describe the show fully however is near impossible, you really have to see it for yourself but without a doubt it really is these parts of the day that make Disneyland what exactly what it is   magical.The park closes after the Disney Dreams show so we headed back for the hotel completely shattered but looking forward to the next day.We were awake at 6am and in for breakfast at 7am again and headed over the Disneyland Park to make use of our magic hours for the day and went straight to the Buzz Lightyear ride. This ride is great fun shooting targets with lazer guns and trying to build up points. It's not too fast and the ride itself is contantly moving so we only queued for 5 minutes. I took it a bit too seriously though and racked up over 100,000 points, much to the amusment of my girlfriend and her son. Whilst we were in Discoveryland we went to see Captain EO   to be honest I didn't see the point in it, it was a bit boring but we are big Michael Jackson fans so it wasn't all that bad. A small documentary is played before you step into the theatre explaining what Captain EO is all about and apparently it caused a big fuss in 1986 when it opened in DisneyWorld in the USA. If it was 1986 now, then yes, I'd probably be blown away by Captain EO, but it's 2012 now so it wasn't that impressive. After that we headed over to Walt Disney Studios Park to see Motuers Action Stunt Show.WOW. We loved this show. I initially thought it was going to just be a few cars doing some stunts and then we all move on, especially when a motorbiker comes out and starts doing wheelies and endo's i thought it was going to be a bit weak. But it wasn't. After a bit of cool car driving a presenter comes out and starts explaining the works of doing stunts on a film set. Another American guy comes out, followed by another chap, and then a whole crew is eventually walking about, setting up scenes and going through the process of filming a stunt. I won't spoil it for you by going into any details but theres fire, glass, guns, glass and awesome stunts all going off and the show is a must if you visit Disney   my girlfriend's 7 year old absolutely loved it.We went and caught the Lilo and Stitch interactive show in english then, which is cleverly done but doesn't last very long. Stitch is very funny however and the kids really enjoyed it so again, worth giving it a go. Myself and my friends fiance were the only two of our group that wanted to go on the Hollywood Tower of Terror so we then went to queue up, which took about 20 minutes. This is a great ride. I'd heard a lot about it through the grapevine so I thought I knew what to expect, but when we were waiting in the 'Maintence Room' my heart was racing. It's a really clever ride if it wasn't for the queue getting bigger I would have gone on it straight away again  amazing.We then watched the Parade in the Studios Park and a few of the characters from the movies drive past in cars, such as Aladdin and Jasmine, Ariel from the Little Mermaid, Cruella de Ville to name a few and then Mickey and Minnie Mouse in the last car. Nice little parade to keep the magic alive. We then had a bit to eat and went back over to Disneyland Park.Back in Disneyland Park we went to the Phantom Manor. I was really looking forward to this in particular as I love the spooky rides however the intro was in French and it wasn't really that spooky, however the sets were really well done and pretty gruesome so it was good from that perspective. We headed back over to catch the main parade then and got there nice and early to get a front row spot. We watched the parade and had a hot chocolate to keep us warm. It only lasts about 10 minutes but it's great to watch and it's lovely to see everyone's faces light up and it was a nice way to bring the final day to a near close. As it was our last night we decided to eat in one of the restaurants on Main Street USA   it was an all you can eat buffet which cost 26 Euros each for the adults and 13 Euros for a child but it was worth the money and the food was delicious, so we ended up getting more than our money's worth. We ended u doing a last bit of shopping for gifts before heading back to the hotel for a much needed sleep before travelling home the following morning.It's not a holiday going to Disneyland Paris, it is tiring, especially for the kiddies, but it really is a great few days away and if you can afford to go at Christmas then do it, it makes Disneyland paris all that bit more magical.Ignore the negativity and dust off your magic carpet and get involved.Disneyland Paris   10 10.",Disneyland_Paris

499525691,2,2017-7,Canada,"Know from the start that this giant development exists for one thing and one thing only...to collect as much of your money as possible in one day and it is clear every step that you take and making money is the key factor in the overall design and layout. The food is insanely overpriced  8 Euros for a hot dog, 25 Euros for a burger..coke 3.5 euros but there is zero competition so they can charge what they want. Be sure to buy passes before arriving as buying at the gate is waaaay more. We bought our passes and tried to get them printed there...no luck or help with that. On average, I would rate the service at 2.5 out of 10...most staff couldn't give a crap of any kind and seemed to want to do anything except talk to you or god help, actually assist you. There were a few decent folks along the way, but nothing higher than 6.5 out of 10 at the very best. Finding a washroom is not easy...they are far away and extremely poorly marked, which is a challenge for younger kids. The lines werent too bad and the fastpass idea works ok for a couple rides per day. The place is basically a large shopping mall dressed up a bit..there is nothing original or unique about the place..its a gaudy mess of claptrap meant to lure the spenders into any room or activty that then push you to buy photos of everything and or spend time in the enormous gift shops that are everywhere. It really is more a mall than anything else. My kids did enjoy many of the rides and the lightshow and fireworks and music at 11pm was quite amazing and everyone enjoyed that. We spent one long day here and that was lots for us..two days would have been too much and too expensive. After spending 11 hours there we saw three characters total.. a pincochio and two squirrels of some kind...broke my kids hearts to not see any of the big characteris like MIckey or Minnie or any of the million or so possibilities. We did enjoy the chance to meet Darth VADER in person in one exhbit that was nice but we couldn't use our own camera but of course could buy a professional one printed.

The headline rides (Pirates, Thunder Mountain etc) of each land feel dated, and dont feel like they should be the headline ride. If you go on a day where there isnt any big crowds, it feels like you can run out of things to do in a day. In conclusion   Disney know how to theme and how to create an atmosphere, and Disneyland Paris has this in abundance, the christmas parade really made me feel like it was christmas. In regards to food prices, i think people are being unfair, you just have to realise that to works out better value to have your main meal at lunch (like France in general).

We have been to 3 different parks now and I was very surprised at the paper on the floor, big puddles everywhere, broken toilets. The park was not crowded at all, so I could not see a reason for this.Also, the food venues are not as plentiful as other parks I have visited. The park was not crowded but all the sit down restaurants were fully booked and many of the walk in places were closed and sparse.",Disneyland_Paris
499426287,3,2017-7,United States,We spent 2.5 days here. The Disneyland park is compact compared to Disney World (DW) Magic Kingdom. The lines are long and the cast members are not so magical. On numerous occasions we over heard cast members talking badly about customers and we were not interacted with in a magical positive way as in DW parks. The park was clean Remember this is a theme park and you will pay theme park prices $$$$,Disneyland_California
149477722,5,2012-10,Australia,Our plans were changed so we had to go on a weekend. So many people & prams. The park itself is amazing but way to many people. Long queues for rides but still had a great day.,Disneyland_California
520661601,5,2017-8,United Kingdom,"Went there 31st August 2017 for many reasons and 1 of them being, it was the cheapest day. I went with a mate n her child and I'm quite a big kid myself so I really enjoyed it. We went for one day literally caught a flight in the morning from London Gatwick and flew back home in the evening. Saved A LOT of money by doing this. Timed it very wisely to the parks opening hours so we had enough time to enjoy ourselves. Spent exactly   93.28 on return flight but would have cost   15 cheaper if I booked it when I first saw it. Now the flight were cheaper because it 'end of summer...back to school week' which also meant that the park would not be as packed and busy which was very true once we got there. Disneyland are also celebrating 25years so they were offering discounts to tickets for the park. I brought my tickets from AttractionTix(which I searched on TripAdvisor to see if they are genuine and reliable ) evidently they were and very great. I got my ticket for TWO parks (Walt Studios and Disneypark) for   39 ! This also included fast track and two vouchers for    10 off for food !! It states that you must print out your parks vouchers but you don't really.To get to Disneyland Paris , we used an Uber. The taxis at the airport were charging by the metre and they reckon it usually cost about    70    90 (what a rip off). There is also a tourist info desk that offers a private bus that will cost an adult    33 and child cheaper of course. They also recommend the public bus but that takes almost 2hours to get there and was cheaper than the bus. With the Uber it takes roughly 30mins and only cost    55 which me and my mate split the fare. And I recommend people use Uber! Overall the park was great. We had beautiful weather and it wasn't really packed. Waiting times on rides were 20  30mins . Loads of food places to eat and shops to buy souvenirs of course. Very beautiful and colourful and would 100% visit again. ",Disneyland_Paris

294860609,5,2015-7,Australia,"We are what Disneyland apparently refers to as a 'family couple without children'   nevertheless we still managed to have a really fun time. We did quite a lot of research as we only had about a half day in Disneyland HK. So we took advice guidance about the best rides, shows and how to limit waiting in queues. We probably went at the worst (ie peak) time   summer and a weekend   but we found that planning is everything and helped us get the most of the experience (and take an umbrella     the sun is fierce). So here is our itinerary and top tips:1. Get there at 10am when the park opens   there was a queue (they do bag checks which slows everything down) but we moved quite quickly and took about 15 mins.2. Walk down Main Street but don't be tempted to stop   there is time for shopping later in the itinerary. 3. Head to the left and follow the signs to Grizzly Gulch   go straight to the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (there were no queues). This is a really fun roller coaster ride and well done. Have a look around after the ride but keep moving! Overall there are short waits for single riders so consider this if you don   t mind not riding together. 4. Then head off to Mystic Point and head to the Mystic Manor ride (again no queues). This was my personal favorite ride     really magical! The rides are quite short really so make sure you enjoy it!5. Two options here     option A: go straight to Adventure Land and take the Jungle River Cruise and then on to Toy Story Land. Or option B: go past Adventure Land and go to Toy Story Land and do the Toy Solider Drop (a silly ride really but the views are good) and the RC Racer     fun! Then come back to the Jungle River Cruise later. The Jungle River cruise was good and we took the English tour which had a much shorter wait but the tour guide was a bit wacky. There were minimal waits at both A   Land and TS   Land about 10     20 mins for these rides. We did option B. 6. We skipped the rides shows in Fantasy Land but did stop for photos of the Sleeping Beauty Castle, and went on to Tomorrow Land to do the Space Mountain (probably the best ride)     you can also get a fast pass here if the wait is long. We decided to queue and had to wait about 30 mins.7. Lunch at the Mystic Manor restaurant     followed by a Micky Mouse ice cream in the nice garden here (about 30 mins break)8. Our second last stop was a show     the Lion King show at 2 pm. This is about 35mins long and was marvellous. 9. Then walk to the Fantasy Station train station and take the train back to Main Street     look at the shops and buy some souvenirs. 10. This itinerary took about 6 hours (10am     4pm) as we had to get a plane at 6pm, but we were moving all the time but it didn't feel too hectic.",Disneyland_HongKong

And I had never been to California Adventure and they had so much construction to walk around first that I could not hold up long enough to even get all the way inside to see it all. Disneyland opened the same month we got married and we still love the place, now days it gets a bit too crowded though, I guess that is just progress.

Couple of downsides, lots of smoking and pushing and shoving, sadly nothing disney can so much about.

The food can be pricey and the opening times for some places vary (some are open 11 3 and some open from 3:30 midnight). It's best to get your food from the Disney Village.We went on just about every ride! The queue times for the parachute drop is poor. The people working on there don't seem to be making an effort to get people on and off the ride quickly. The queue time said 35minutes... we waited an hour.Everything else was perfect!",Disneyland_Paris
561608858,5,2018-2,United Kingdom,"I first visited Disneyland Paris in May 2013, My daughter was then 4. Now aged 9, I decided to treat her and make a 2nd visit. I remember what it was like on my first visit so was preparing myself for pretty much the same rude treatment, people smoking and long Q's for the rides.Well i hold my hands up things have changed for the better. We went during half term Feb 12th   16th, and too my surprise the Q times were pretty good, I think the most time we waited was 40 45 mins for a ride, most of the ride times advertised 25 30 mins, we even managed to get through quicker sometimes.My biggest problem when i visited in 2013 was the amount of attractions that were in french, we built the euro tunnel to make it easier and quicker for the brits french to visit each other I thought the park should accommodate the english language more. I'm happy to say they do now, all the parades were a mixture of french and english, as was Pirates of the Caribbean and buzz lightyear lazer blast. The park announcements were in about 4 different languages. But my biggest surprise was Star Tours, this ride was always in french and as good as the ride is you walked off thinking what were they saying, we went on the ride 4 times over our visit and on the 4th ride the whole thing was in english, I've found out from the disneyland paris facebook page that star tours has 11 different videos so really nearly every time you ride you should get a different experience but of course the language will be random, probably favoring the french language.I brought the half board meal tickets because the park is expensive for food. This hasn't changed. Just to give you an idea, a roll and drink cost 12 euros, in the main restaurants they give you meal options 1 6 these meals cost 16 or 17 euro (Burger chips drink & pudding) that is just a ridiculous amount of money, because they are set meals everything is all pre set up and just sitting under heat lamps, the burgers are very poorly put together. The buffet restaurants an adult price is about 33 euros. There are plenty of characters to see, although none of them walk around the park, they all have their designated area to stand, the Q's for this is understandably very long, a lot of guests have an autograph book which just adds more waiting time and also depending on the character they tend to have a little play with the kids, which although frustrating to watch, when it comes to your turn you lap it up and take your time, some have a professional photographers but you can also take your own pictures and the staff are more than willing to take pictures for you so everyone can be in the picture.During our visit we did nearly every ride in the park, doing big thunder mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean & star tours 4 times each. I would say don't bother with mad hatters tea cups, it seems that they leave the brakes half on, i'm a nutter when it comes to these spinning rides and i could hardly move it, nearly putting my back out trying.My first review of disney I only gave it 3 stars (average) after my 2nd visit i'm changing it to 5, although the food is still very expensive. Also with many people changing to vaping rather than smoking, there was very little smoking and vaping for that matter in the park, this made the experience a lot more enjoyable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I'm still missing the place and can't wait to go back.",Disneyland_Paris
128240852,5,2012-4,Canada,If you don't mind a crowd than you'll be just fine. I have heard that it is way quieter in november however I went in April and have also been there in March and July. All these months it is a steady pace of people. Be prepared to do alot ALOT of walking. My children were ages 6 and were still needing a stroller which is just fine and you will see many children that age and some older who are in strollers. It makes it funner for them. All staff are friendly as can be. Use fastpasses to make rides more bareable. If you so your research this will be the happiest holiday you and your kids will have. Even if you go at a busy time If you get up early you will beat the crowd and be able to walk on to alot of attractions. Schedule one day for rest.,Disneyland_California

303322460,4,2015-6,United Kingdom,"I absolutely love Disneyland! I've been coming here all my life, and even at the age of 20, it is still so enjoyable for me. I recently travelled here with my boyfriend, and we had such a blast. The rides are suitable for all ages, with 5 6 different  lands  including Fantasyland, Discoveryland, Frontierland and Adventureland. Each land has a variety of rides, all suitable for all ages. I recommend going on Pirates of Caribbean as this was my favourite ride as a kid and still enjoy it now! The whole of adventure land is my favourite as there are caves and mazes to enjoy too. There are also some old rides which are still super fun like Star Wars which is a simulation. I would say to give this park an entire day, and not try to do the Studios AND Disneyland in one day as this is almost impossible especially with the long line ups. The only thing i would say, is that i wish there were more  Fast track  opportunities for more rides as some lines can be up to 2 hours in holiday period :( However, I definitely recommend for all the family, and i will be going back for years from now!",Disneyland_Paris
252887028,2,2014-6,United States,"My family are all huge fans of Disney. We've been to WDW resorts, watch the films, and have come to expect quite a lot from the brand when it comes to quality. While my children and I had a good time, it was almost in spite of the cast members and the overall upkeep of the Disneyland Paris park.I can't fault the park itself for long queues. I can, however, fault them for dingy rides that desperately need a fresh coat of paint. The entirety of Frontier Land reeked of garbage water. Cast members wandered about in packs, chatting amongst themselves totally disinterested in the guests (which would get them fired in WDW). Trash wasn't picked up, fountains were dirty, and the whole park had an overall  tired  feel to it.One of the daily parades broke down (I know, things happen) and it took nearly an hour to get it back up and running again. That's ridiculous. I know I keep making comparisons to WDW, but it cannot be helped. WDW would have had things up and running in minutes. It just seems that Disneyland Paris really doesn't care about creating a magical atmosphere. Disney Paris is just another amusement park that happens to have Mickey Mouse.With that said, it *is* still Disney. My children had a marvelous time, we met plenty of characters (MAKE RESERVATIONS and DOUBLE CHECK), and most of the rides were up and running when we were there. Cast members, for the most part, were polite. There was plenty to do and the children were absolutely charmed by the scenery, topiaries, characters, rides, and parades.

149584486,4,2012-12,Greece,"We visited the park with my 10 years old son and we had a great time. I had visited Disneyland in Orlando, USA many years ago and I think that I liked it better than Eurodisney. However if you live in Europe, choosing Eurodisney is an one way decision. Children at the age of 10 want to prove that they are not babys, so we visited almost nothing else but the  dangerous  games (Space Mountain, BigThunder Mountain, Indiana Jones etc) again and again and again. They found thw quiet ones  boring and not interesting , so it might be a good idea to take them for a visit at the age between 6 and 9. The 2  extra magic  hours (8 10 a.m.) offered to those who stay at the Parks' hotels is not really much, because not all the lands are open (only Fantasyland and Discoveryland) and then again in those 2 lands not all the attractions are open (only certain games, such as Caroussel, Mad Hatter's Tea Cups, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Orbitron etc, but not the popular Autopia or Pinocchio or Blanche Neige). We met a lot of Disney characters through the park and the children were really excited and very happy. We went there in December (1st week), so it was not crowded and the waiting lines were very short. It was however freezing cold and getting dark was very early (around 5 o'clock). The park closed at 7 p.m., so you have less time than visiting in summer (where the park is open until 11 p.m.) but due to the cold you can anyway not stand to stay any longer.

We had not been to the Paris park for 14 years and it didnt look as though anything had been done in the intervening years! On the positive side it is Disney, and we had a great time all together. But there are lots of things to complain about. Firstly, for the amount it costs, both the entrance and then everything else thereafter. the food everywhere inside is horrendously expensive, quite revolting and served by staff who really look as though they really want to be somewhere else. On the staff, not all of them were bad, but they could do with some customer service training, and it would be nice if they smiled, and there were a few more of them. The park itself needs some care. The grounds look unkempt with loads of weeds and untrimmed shrubs and bushes.The rides have flaking paintwork, and parts of them were broken, and cynically the only buildings that look as though they have been treated are the shops.Lastly, the grounds and restaurants all had lots of rubbish around, with a few staff trying valiantly to keep it at bay. It was not very busy, and i can only imagine how awful it is in high season. As for The Disney village it was foul. Smelly,Dirty and expensive, and again needs more staff in the bars and restaurants. We waited ages for mediocre food in both Rainforest cafe and Planet Hollywood, and there was 1 barman serving.

We loved everything about the park, the lines weren't too long when we visited, the whole place was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed the Indianna Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean ride as well as the older rides like Peter Pan, Dumbo, Snow White, Haunted House and Toon Town area. Enjoyed wandering down Main Street and watching the character parade too. Really loved California Adventure Park and will do a review on that as well. Everyone should channel their inner child and go to Disneyland! Loved it!!",Disneyland_California

532179238,5,2017-6,Hong Kong,"From the start it is an adventure! From the sunny bay MTR train station there is the Disney train that goes straight to the park. You could take a taxi but the train completes the Disney experience here. You should take the train. One comes every 3 mins.While quite a bit smaller than Disney in Orlando, FL, this Disney packs a lot of great things in. It has tons of great rides for the small ones and everyone else, including tea cups and dumbo. There is also Space Mountain but it is Star Wars themed and SUPER cool!!! Our favourite ride by far!!! It's like being in the scenes of the death Star battle with Tie fighters and x wings zooming in every direction. Our 7yo son thought it was a bit loud and fast but this was the first rollercoaster he has ever been on.We all really enjoyed the jungle boat ride  our guide was very funny! Tarzana tree house was also a favourite.Get your pictures with Micky, Minie, Cinderella, and all the Star Wars characters too !!!!We went on a Wednesday at 11 and it was great bc it was not crowded and we waited only 5 mins to get on rides!!!! That's almost unheard of!!!!The castle is small but still cool to see. We didn't stay for the parade. It would have made for too long a day. We live near Disney here in HK and get the pleasure is seeing the fireworks over the water every night. It's always cool to see!It's a great park with lots of great rides and things to do!!",Disneyland_HongKong
400242663,3,2016-6,United Kingdom,A great park but why close main rides at one time To take teens and have Rock n roller coaster and big thunder mountain and star tours closed was so disappointing as one of the main reasons for the visit and no pre warning or would have deferred the visit That a side it's a magical place and we loved the other rides especially small world and space mountain The parade was magical and fireworks fantastic Staff so helpful Would have been a 5 star review if all rides were open ,Disneyland_Paris

375796836,3,2015-12,Canada,Make sure you take 2 days just to do this park. Large park with small walkways and older fast pass system compared to Orlando. It's a great park and always a great time at a Disney park just longer lines so make sure to plan 2 days there.,Disneyland_Paris
377740884,5,2016-5,United Kingdom,Spent 5 days here with my 2 friends we are all in our 20s no had a magical holiday. The end of the night show on the castle is magical. If you are there during the week I would advise visiting the characters midweek rather than the weekend and queue times are significantly higher over the weekend.Selfie sticks are banned in Disney but people still use them you are just politely asked not to by the extra friendly staff.Can't wait to return ,Disneyland_Paris
296321238,5,2015-7,United Kingdom,"I visited Disneyland Paris in July with my 16 daughter. We stayed for 5 nights 6 days in the Sequoia Lodge hotel and we absolutely loved everything! We had the best time and I would really struggle to find fault at all. We certainly made the most of our trip   up for breakfast every day at seven, in the park for eight and didn't leave each day until after Disney Dreams. Yes we were shattered but it was worth it!We went on all the rides, met loads of characters and had some wonderful meals. We didn't have to queue for more than an hour for any rides (and that was only a couple of them. Most queues were less than half an hour). For the time of year we visited we thought this was very good. I also have to give a special mention to all the Cast Members we met during our stay. Every member of staff was charming, helpful and happy. I've read other reviews which have said they found the staff to be rude but I honestly didn't see any of that. I really couldn't praise them enough, many of them went out of their way to chat and make sure we were having a great time.

258676441,2,2015-3,Ireland,"We attended disneyland for 4 days. We stayed at cheyanne hotel with half board.. first of all hotel was good .set as a wild west theme.the rooms were small and very basic but we didnt mind that.. half board consists with few cereals and rolls with ham,no hot food . Was sick of eating same crap each morning. The shuttle bus from hotel is great and comes every 5 10 mins.disneyland itself is nice the kid loved it. As for parents it has to be one of the dearest places in the world. Absolute disgraceful prices, a total rip off. The found is disgusting in every restaurant, the drinks very dear and are watered down . We had half board but there was not much selection, all was cheapy buffet found. And the worst part about disneyland is the waiting times. Queing for 2 and a half hours to go on a ride for 40 seconds is madness. Another 2 hours to see a princess which last for a minute. No matter what you want to do in disneyland, prepare to que a minimum of 2 hours, the restaurant ques are not much better. You spend most your day queing which really turned me off going here again. My child liked it but we couldnt enjoy it as the queing took its toll and we stopped . We wont be returning to disneyland paris again. Was certainly not worth the money. Absolute Rip off ",Disneyland_Paris

207880534,2,missing,United Kingdom,I have been to US Disney several times and was shocked how poor Paris is in comparison.Several of the rides were shut down throughout the 2 days we were there due to 'technical difficulties'. This included the big rides such as Thunder Mountain. The fast pass system was a shambles with the machines breaking down every 10 mins. Several other rides were closed. The food was disgusting   I had half a chicken that must have been cooked for hours it was like eating rubber. Some of the staff were incredibly miserable ...not that there were many around.All in all this feels like a place that is on the way to going out of business   it won't of course as people will still flock here because of the Disney brand but the truth is that this place damages that brand beyond belief   my advice is save your pennies and go to Florida   that's where the real magic happens ,Disneyland_Paris
174445678,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,Disneyland Paris was wonderful for us as a family. It is never easy traveling with a child who has a disability but the staff at the parks and our accommodation were absolutely brilliant and made the holiday really easy.

For me a disappointment comparing with Orlando, shops and people who works there weren't friendly at all, games  entertainment looks old and needs upgrade, food in the park is really bad and expensive.,the big show was not what I expect from a Disney show.., that for a 60th anniversary???I will not take the kids again.. Not worth it.",Disneyland_California
148334660,5,2012-12,Singapore,"This was our second trip to Hong Kong Disneyland. The park was magical as before, but this time we spent two days in the park, and I was honestly surprised by the quality of the food I found in the park. Specifically, we had dinner in the Banquet Hall   a food court of sorts with international type food. The food was served piping hot, which was lovely in the winter evening. And the pasta and pizzas we ordered surpassed our expectations of what you would get in a theme park. It warmed us up nicely in time for sitting out in the cold waiting for the fireworks. The quantities were also fairly decent. Two mains fed us and our toddler quite nicely. Surprisingly, not many people seemed to stay till dinner, so the hall was pretty quiet, with lots of places and absolutely no lines. What a relief!",Disneyland_HongKong
221090433,5,2014-7,United States,My children and I loved the rides (even 72 year old mom loved them) but I would advise to go early and to definately use the fast pass system.

482042465,1,2017-5,Australia,Don't waste your time and money here. Your kids get 3 4 rides a day as each ride has 1.5 hour long wait times. Too many people allowed in each day for such a small facility.,Disneyland_Paris
267211101,3,missing,United States,"Having been to Disneyland in California a bunch of times, I had in mind what Disneyland Paris might have been like. I assumed there would be many similarities and also some differences, but I didn't except half a park for the same amount of money for a ticket. The lay out was pretty much the same and followed the one in California, but I was shocked at how small the park actually was. We walked the whole park from left to right with stops to check on rides in about 45 minutes. It was crazy. We had two days there and honestly we could've done it in only one full day. We went on a Friday and surprisingly it wasn't to crowded. The kid rides were obviously longer but the two we wanted to do (it's a small world and Peter Pan) were only 15 30 minute wait. The Peter Pan line was always full so if you want to go on that one then get there early and plan on waiting. The sign never said the wait was longer than 30 min so I don't know how accurate any of those wait times actually are. Phantom Manor, Indiana Jones and Big Thunder were all down while we were there. Luckily they opened back up so we could ride them. I was disappointed in the Indiana Jones ride. Theirs is a roller coaster which is fine but the safety bar was not padded and throws your head around and gave me a huge headache. Add some padding and it would be fun! Phantom Manor was one of my favorites and I think a little better than the one in California. It's a small world was way better. It was brighter and cleaner. It puts the one in California to shame. Another thing we loved was the parades. They were great! There were so many different characters than the ones we have and were fun to watch. The parades happened often which was nice if you missed a part or just wanted to watch it again. We saw the Spring Parade, a big parade (not sure the name of that one) and The Mary Poppins Show. They were great to watch and I'm not a person that likes to watch parades or shows and deal with the crowds that do but I really enjoyed them! The dancers were very talented and it was just mesmerizing to watch them dance. The costumes the guys wore was cute and the dresses the girls had were pretty. And they were just beautiful people. The staff there was happy, helpful and very welcoming. They spoke English very well and didn't act put out using it to communicate with you. I was thankful for that. The food was of course expensive. We went to the Mexican food place the first day and I wasn't happy with it. I got the nachos and the chips were some gross, generic Doritos and came with a packet of guacamole and a salsa sauce. Not what I was expecting. The next day we went to The Hakuna Matata Restaurant in Adventureland. I ordered the chicken fingers and fry meal and my sister ordered the kebab meal. The food was good but if I ever went back I would just get the fries. The fries were so good and crispy. Overall it was a check off the bucket list but if we had more people with us I don't think it would've been worth the money. Definitely go during the week and not when kids are out of school. If you have gone to Disneyland or Disneyworld in the states don't expect the same stuff. It was cool to hear the rides and characters you love speaking in French. ",Disneyland_Paris
310044792,5,2015-9,Qatar,"I love HK Disneyland it has even thing, not as big as the one in Orlando, so it is more enjoyable, for some reason, I think the staff is more friendly and they are willing to help you in any way.The park is very convenient not only because of its size is also because of the access to it, you can go by taxi from the hotel or if you want more adventure the MTR is very helpful way to go there.

The younger one is still interested enough in Disney princesses to make this a really wow experience     meeting the princesses and watching the shows, really made her summer. The queues as can be expected are huge for the popular rides but the free fast track system helps with that. The rides are great and even if you have been to other Disney parks (we have visited Florida, HK and California), it always feels new to me     I am and remain a big kid at heart. We all had a fabulous time here, food at the park is varied with several cuisine options     good enough to provide the fuel to hit more rides. We felt quite secure (as we did in other parts of Paris) and the presence of some armed guards around the place didn   t in anyway detract from the fun atmosphere. All the staff are jovial and helpful and appear to genuinely love their job and want to ensure everyone has a positive experience.

You can do the whole park in a half day. Don   t go on a Chinese Holiday or it will be flooded with Mainland Chinese tourists. Pretty much the same as every other Disneyland just 10% of the size. Take advantage of the fast pass system. If your ticket is crumpled or broken and the machine won   t accept it, there is a small inconspicuous button on the back of the fastpass machine that will print a fast pass ticket for you. Unscrupulous visitors can press it repeatedly to get multiple rides without waiting in line. Visit the rides that don   t have fast pass first or last thing.

This was our first visit outside of spring or summer  we came in mid September. If you'd rather ride the rides than stand in the lines, it's the perfect time for a visit. Only Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, and Radiator Springs Racers had wait times of any significance, and were never longer than an hour. Everything else was about 5 20 minutes.

Being spring break we had to wait a lot to get on the rides.

638288602,3,2018-12,France,"Disneyland Paris, the land of dreams, seems to me WALT never had it hard in his life and must of had a life of luxury. I thought he was a man of magic, the only magic I saw was people   s money disappearing. YOU need to have a hell of a lot of money to visit here, shops are double the price of Disney stores at home. Food and drink outlets are overpriced and you don   t get much food for the money your spending. Your talking    65 for a three course SET menu for one adult, that   s one meal for the day so start counting what you need for breakfast and lunch as well. You can get burger and fries but that   s    16 plus euros each too. The drinking fountains don   t work, so don   t forget your    5 or more for every drink you want, and believe me it   s thirsty work queuing and walking all day. This takes away the magic right away. There are NO characters walking about and if you want to see a character, you have to queue or book to see one. Or PAY to see them and have dinner, this is more than your weekly wage. So try telling a 5 year old, you can   t see them as the queue is full of adults wanting to see Mickey, Minnie or whoever because them adults haven   t grown up yet and they booked or paid to see him. Full grown up people taking away the magic from children. Euro Disney have a princess castle, but for some reason only one princess at a time is in the castle, so be prepared to wait 3 hours, yep 3 hours. The parades are repetitive everyday and night. My 5 year old loved the rides but did she find it magical, to be honest, not really, she had to queue for hours at a time. The children are not allowed on adult rides but yet the grown ups who haven   t grown up yet (to me, they aren   t right in the head) are allowed on the kids rides. Keep your money and go to Florida. Florida would work out cheaper and they have plenty of characters walking about and you get tons of food for your money and pleasant workers who smile. oh yes and it   s warm. Euro Disney was nice to see but that   s about it. ",Disneyland_Paris

Sleeping beauty castle is amazing and do not miss the ride through the castle. The festival of lion king at the adventureland is very good. Please note the timing of shows beforehand so as not to miss them. The disney parade is impressive. Make sure you get your position atleast 30min before as the public lines up in the front very early and the view might get blocked for the small kids. To enjoy the park I recommend 1 day atleast or may be 2 days. It cannot be done in half day with kids. You can greet the charcters and click photos but the waiting time is around 20 min for very popular ones like micky, minnie or pooh. for others it is little less.Fellow Indians you will get very good vegetarian indian food at the tahitian terrace restaurant at the adventureland.We missed the fireworks as it got cancelled due to weather conditions.",Disneyland_HongKong

The food was good and even though the park was super busy with Labor Day and the Disney run events that took place. The lines were long on some rides but not on others. The nighttime parade was amazing. Certainly a must. Otherwise coming back to visit the park is like coming home. I can't wait to go back. Happy 60th anniversary Disney. ,Disneyland_California
549441779,5,2017-12,Singapore,"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. I have been fortunate enough to visit the non Asian Disney parks (including the tremendous parks in Orlando) and I was expecting the Hong Kong version to be perhaps a bit underwhelming. Not so. It had all the crowd pleasers and some rather unique experiences not found in the other parks. Both my child and the adults accompanying loved our visits.Deserving special mention would be the Mystic Manor and Runaway mine car rides. Mystic Manor was their take on the Haunted Mansions of the other Disney parks. It had minimal ghostly effects though and was all the better for it. It was an enchanting trackless ride in a choreographed group of four ride vehicles through an atmospheric and enchanting set of rooms (depending on which pair of vehicles you take you get a slightly different ride perspective; my favorite is the front pair). One of the better rides in any Disney park. The runaway mine cars rides is also a very well judged roller coaster ride with three distinct ride segments that will ensure everyone gets something they enjoy. Also enjoyed the Star Wars treatment of the Space Mountain ride.Park staff were friendly, park and toilets clean and food tasty. There are halal options for Muslim guests who should note that the turkey hot dog stand next to the bakery near the entrance is the only such stand in the park that has halal meat. Some restaurants are also halal certified.Really enjoyed my visit and would come again.

Disneyland is fun with the whole family, but it also fun to visit as a couple. We had a great time. Got to ride everything we wanted to, despite the grad night crowds. Indiana Jones broke down once and then got backed up because of that when it was up and running again. The problem was the staff letting people into the temple were just letting all of the fast people on and would wait 2 3 minutes before letting people in the regular line on. They tried to tell us they were letting standby people on every 30 seconds but we (and several other people) timed it and called them on it. They finally started doing that. Maybe they were new, not sure. When we were done with the ride, 3 managers came marching up the exit to go in the ride and they didn't look happy. Hope no one got in too much trouble.

We decided to go on a Tuesday in Late October thinking that there would be less crowds. WRONG! Disneyland and Disney Studios is much smaller than other Disney parks. However, the lack of order and management are the real concern, but perhaps this is just a French thing? The French patrons of the park DO NOT like to wait in lines for things so people jumping the line and cutting in front of others is rampant. The park management does nothing about this, so it makes the experience unpleasant for those of us trying to follow the rules.Fast Pass. We thought that at least we could use the fast pass system to ride some things. NOPE. The park opened at 0800 and we got through the gates at 0830. At 0830 ALL FAST PASSES WERE SOLD OUT. Isn't that impossible? Can't you only hold one fast pass at a time? I guess not. I think that you can go around to all the fast pass machines and collect as many as you want right at the beginning.

277006765,4,2015-5,United Kingdom,"Ok, I have read a lot of reviews comparing Disney World in Florida to Disneyland Paris. This is never going to be a fair comparison. Disney Florida is huge, including 5 well established parks over a vast area. Disneyland Paris is restricted in area and established long after Disneyworld, in 1992.So my review is based on a comparison between my first visit in 2002 and another just recently on 28 29 May 2015.First, we visited during UK half term school holiday, French school holiday being the week before therefore overcrowding was not an issue. The weather was also on our side.We took full advantage of the Fast Pass system, allowing for the use of your park tickets to reserve a place on a ride hours before and to return during an allotted time slot and jump the queue. One of us went on ahead to the next themed area of the park to Fast Pass the next possible ride. A note on Fast Pass, more rides should have this option such as  Crush's Roller Coaster  and a ride in Toy Story land in Disney Studio's. Also all rides could have a single rider line, some do, which is a big improvement from 2002. Fast Pass should be made available until park closing rather than finishing around 3pm.Some rides were closed, like Space Mountain and the Flying Carpets but there were still plenty of other rides to do and areas to explore. My daughter loved the pirate caves in Adventure Land, we spent a lot of time exploring, something the Disney Studios park could benefit more of: exploration and play areas for kids of all ages. Improvements are that all attractions are now in English and French, the staff are very friendly and helpful (thoroughly  Disneyfied ) and the parks have matured significantly, the greenery and landscaping does well to mask the smaller size of the parks, especially the Disneyland park, I found myself admiring how Adventureland was lit at night with lanterns hanging from the trees, good job.A particular highlight for us included,  Stitch Live  in Disney Studios, this is a gem, not many in attendance, kids and adults loved it. Done this twice with a change in script each time.Toy Story land is too small (with crowds I could imagine that it would be inaccessible), rides are poor, basically fairground type rides with a Toy Story makeover. Although the Drill Instructor Emery commentary (see Full Metal Jacket intro : )) on the parachute drop helped pass the 40min queue time.This is really the only area for younger kids  5yr old in the Disney Studios park.You must Fast Pass Ratatouille ride as soon as you can get into the park, we arrived at 9.30am and got Fast Pass for 3.15pm. It is a new ride and worth doing.Always love the Rock and Roller coaster, not sure if it was just our luck but from 5pm onwards the wait times were  10mins, best ride in the park in my 7 year old girls opinion. Aerosmith rock.The laser light and fireworks show in the Disneyland park is too late at 11pm, unless you are staying on site in a Disney hotel.Overall I would say lots of improvements. 1 day in each park is sufficient depending on the time of year of your visit, so research school holidays well and you might be lucky to avoid crowds.Usual rules apply, bring your own lunch, drink water and fill up at the water fountains, don't eat lunch in park restaurants if you value your Euros. To save money for shopping, eat dinner at either the Buzz Pizza Planet or Adventureland Pizza Pavilion.For your Disney Studios visit, the park closed for us at 6pm, so bypass Downtown Disney restaurants and get a much better and cheaper meal in Paris.Get the big rides done early such as Tower of Terror, and if you are not one for the parades, then this is probably the best time to access shorter queuing times.Wear comfortable shoes, especially if you are the Fast Pass runner, keeps you fit anyway : )Watch out for show times exceptions they are not very obvious in the daily programme, would be good to see additional information on show times at each of the various stages.The Parade was fantastic, getting a good spot even with limited crowds means establishing a position en route 1 hour in advance, so someone bring a kindle and one of those paper type things with lots of pages.Don't buy your tickets direct from Disney, there are much cheaper alternative online as we did.",Disneyland_Paris
449763926,4,2016-3,United States,It was nice but not as extensive as Disney in the US.  It was good none the less but would not recommend as there are so many cultural activities that spending a day at Disney in France was not the best use of time.,Disneyland_Paris
310502844,5,2015-7,Australia,"It was awesome seeing the original Disney park during it's 60th Anniversary. It was crowded (to be expected) but the cast members and park managed really well. We rode each ride and saw each attraction at least once in 2 days so it is definitely possible to tackle the whole park in a weekend! The first day, the park stayed open till 1am (instead of 12 midnight) and we ended up spending 16 hours at the park! We had soo much fun, we didn't feel tired at all! My biggest regret was that it was raining both days and our VIP viewing passes went to waste as the Fantasmic! shows were cancelled on both days due to weather. That's okay as it's obviously out of anyone's control.",Disneyland_California

Last time we visited it was christmas time, it was snowing and it was magical. There are lots of rides, shops and restaurants. The Disney village is good for food and shopping but extremely expensive, even the McDonald's has premium price. I would go back but I think going to the Florida one would probably work out cheaper!",Disneyland_Paris
115247646,5,2011-7,United States,"Last weekend I took my 8 year neice to Disneyland. This was her first time there and she told me that it was the  Happiest Day Ever . When I heard that I knew that paying the high ticket price, high parking price, high food prices, high hotel price for two days, waiting over an hour in line to get on a 5 minute ride, and suffering foot pain with blisters was all worth it. It's about the kids not me. Disneyland can be the happiest place on earth if you face it with an open mind and heart. The park was very crowded after 2 p.m. Catching the train saved time and helped lessen foot pain. Plan the park out and don't try to see it all in one day. I would recommend you get a hotel so you can have a place to rest. We tour the park from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Had lunch at the Rainforest Cafe in Downtown Disney. Went back to the hotel from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Return feeling relaxed and ready to take on the night crowd. It is very crowded at night because people want to see the shows and fireworks. I think they should dump the night show and only focus on fireworks. Disneyland did not do a good job controling the crowds. People everywhere with no place to go. It was a true traffic jam. Every ride was open and working which was a surprise to me. Overall, the park is a great place to take the kids.",Disneyland_California
633903327,2,2018-11,Czechia,"We went to Disneyland specifically on friday in november, thinking it would be less crowded at that time of the year. Well it was pretty crowded anyway, most of the waiting times were between 30   60 minutes. I cannot imagine how it is in summer. We didn't manage to meet the princesses or mickey and didnt ride Pinocchio as these were 60mins  of waiting at all times and we just do not love waiting in lines. Must be even worse for children. What was really disappointing is the number of breakdowns, not only Phanton manor and the raiload was closed for refurbishment but during the day Buzz and Thunder mountain broke. We had FPs for those so we just had to throw them away.As for the disney characters there is not many at all, good luck meeting them. Except for the parade where you can see them for a few seconds.As for the staff, they did not smile at all so it seemed like they were not enjoying their work at all. As for the food there were not many lines but the food for the price was disgusting. When I buy loaded fries for 11 eur I would at least expect real guacamole, same goes for a 6 eur hot chocolate, it was just cocoa in water with a lot of sugar. I would definitely not allowed my children to eat there. The merch was also pretty overpriced (2 eur for a postcard or 10 eur for keychain?).The christmas decoration was also pretty disappointing tbh, there were some lights ans a christmas tree on the main street but not thaz much decoration around. Did not feel the christmas atmosphere.All in all I wouldnt go again at all.",Disneyland_Paris
172302573,3,2013-8,United States,"Disneyland was Okay but not something I would even think about going back to any time soon. I am a spoiled Disney World person. The wow factor is NOT there with Disneyland. The people are not nearly as friendly who work there, the people standing holding signs talking about porn and sexual stuff in front of my kiddos was not a highlight either. Disney World is a way of life for the people who work there, Disneyland is not. I am also disappointed in the meal selections for ages 10 to 15. I understand Disney is considering these  adults  and charging them adult prices, but they have nothing that a 10 year old would want to eat. It's ridiculous. The park itself lacks the room that Disney World Magic Kingdom has. Overall, I would not return here anytime soon.",Disneyland_California

Disneyland is a great park and has some rides that the parks in Florida do not have. However, we do not feel like Disneyland is kept up as nice as the parks in Florida (e.g., paint). Do not get me wrong, Disneyland is great, but I think Magic Kingdom is truly the happiest place on Earth (if you can ignore all the rude visitors at all of the parks).",Disneyland_California

We didnt go on the daring rides but the other rides are not v exciting or worth waiting in d queue for. We enjoyed it's a small world and buzzlight. The shows were ok. The parade at 5.30 looked ok but people filed to watch it from before 5 so we didnt see much.My younger ine was disappointed that frozen was nowhere to be seen, neither activities related to her (notwithstanding that frozen merchandise was everywhere).

His attitude only improve when she eventually speak to him in English. We can feel the distinct discrimination to Chinese especially to those from mainland.

It hasn't changed. You know exactly what you'll get with Disney   saccharine sweetness, Christmas music in November and a brilliant set of rides.We turned up pretty much as soon as it opened and stayed until it closed. A surprising number of rides we expected to be popular (Aerosmith Rock 'n' Roller and Space Mountain 2) had wait times of less than five minutes,and we went on everything we intended to   the highlight being, as with my first visit, a go on the Tower of Terror   a standard drop ride made exciting by the acting skills of the staff and a brilliant set up.In all honesty though, the site is looking a little tired. We ate Beef Tacos in one of the cafes in Adventureland and it looked pretty run down. There are a few rides that need a bit of a lick of paint, and it doesn't meet the perfecting standards that you expect from Disney   especially considering how expensive it is. I'll refuse the temptation of calling it a Mickey Mouse operation. Damn. I failed.So, great fun, great rides, good value for money, but probably not worth another visit until they tidy it up and get some more stuff in. For adults without children going, It seriously needs a revamp. The Disney magic is starting to lose its sheen...",Disneyland_Paris

5146705,4,missing,United States,"As a native Californian, I'm ashamed to admit that I haven't been to Disneyland in 16 years. This was my first trip back with my husband and 2 children, ages 2 and 4. We also traveled with my neice, age 11 and my parents, who probably don't want me to disclose thier ages. The trip was awesome. I can't believe how much has changed. I think Disney did a great job with the expansion of Cal Adven and Downtown Disney. It took some creative planning, but they pulled it off in the usual fine Disney fashion.Okay, okay, back to Disneyland. We were there from May 7 11, 2006. We purchase the 3 day hopper passes. On a positive note, there were very few lines or wait times because school hasn't let out yet, but that also means the parks have shorter operating hours. It was very difficult to squeeze everything into these three days. I would definitely return during the off season, but perhaps extend our park hoppers by a day or two. Also because we didn't go to the park on a Saturday or Sunday, we missed the big fireworks and parade. Thankfully my daughter has no clue what she missed and I wasn't about to tell her. Also on a bit of a sour note, the characters were not readily available for meet & greets or getting autographs. Everytime we'd get in line to see Jasmine or Ariel, we'd wait about 10 minutes, then they would scurry away with their attendents, and it was made abundantly clear that they were not available. We were able to see Pluto, Goofy, & Minnie. Ironically, the only time we saw Mickey was in the parade. I wish, for my 4 year old daughters sake that she could've met more princesses.Okay, I'm done gripping. Our trip was magical. The food at the parks was good, expensive, but good. There was adequate room for strollers and hardly any wait times for the rides. We took advantage of our early entry vouchers which was well worth it. Cal Adven was great too. My neice and husband loved the rides there and the little ones loved Bug land!All and all our visit was magical. I'm already planning another visit for next year.",Disneyland_California

Water fountains were not working in parks but we filled our water bottles from the hotel..

454711163,3,2017-1,United Kingdom,"Disney is always a good idea, especially when celebrating a joint birthday. Overall we had a lovely time, however compared to other Disney parks, Orlando and California, this park is missing that 'extra magic'.Whereas the majority of cast members were friendly, there were a higher percentage of times where cast members were unpleasant and didn   t project the Disney look. Main issues we experienced:Hello   goodbye   when entering the park, it is common curtsy to welcome and say goodbye to guests. Over the duration of our stay I think we only got welcomed once during the whole time. Many of the cast members seemed moody and unapproachable. It was as if they didn   t care. Park cleanliness   the litter in the trash cans (especially in the attraction lines) were over filled and spilling onto the floor, again not the Disney look. Some trash cans had ripped stickers, chipped paint and generally lacked the high Disney standards as seen in other parks. Quick service   When placing an order the Cast members weren't friendly. Over the course of the 3 days no one once said please or thank you, very unfriendly or polite. Smoking 'everywhere'   Although Disney has designated smoking areas, many of the guest seem to smoke wherever they liked. I have never experienced this in any other Disney park and found it highly annoying. We saw a number of Cast members walk past them but fail to approach or ask them to not smoke. Again, it was like they didn   t care. Overall   the park is architecturally beautiful; however it does have its flaws. It   s good, but missing that Disney magic. ",Disneyland_Paris

Let's start with the drive in, ... waited in line for 40 min to park.... from parking it is a walk to the tram which we had to wait 3 trams before arriving at the park. We already had tickets but the line to get in with tickets was about 15 minutes. It was so crowded that there were 2 3 hrs waits for most attractions. Fastpass was either not available or available during the 11pm 12am slot. There were three extremely rude Disney staff there. I had NEVER experienced that. One staff was yelling so loudly in the restroom the bday girl had to hold her ears and looked terrified. Three kiddos between the ages of 5 9 (one bday girl age 5) were unable to do more than 4 attractions in 10 hours. Navigating through the park was like driving on the 405 during bad traffic. It was not only crowded, it was like a can of sardines. Awful, never experienced this before and if there are many days like this now in the park, there will eventually be less customers. When the day is so overcrowded ....as this day was, admissions should be limited so some enjoyment can be had from families spending  magical  funds. No so. cal discount, no one day discounts. AWFUL.

It was a wet day, but that was no dampener to the kids who were really super excited about being there. Though we went on a Monday, when i thought crowds would be relatively fewer, it quickly filled up, and by noon, it was usual to see a waiting time of 20 minutes to 30 minutes or more for most of the interesting rides. While we waded into as many as we could pack in during the day, what i really missed out on was the DIsney shows. Because almost each show needed you to wait for anything between 45 minutes to 2 hours to get in. That to me, leaves visitors with a very clear choice. Visit Disneyland for the shows or the rides. You just can't pack in both in a day. Even over two days, it would be difficult if these are usual wait times. I shudder to think what happens on weekends. The really smart strategy would of course be to do the rides in Ocean park, and more of the shows in Disney, where it has a clear edge. Until the Iron Man ride gets ready next year:)Having said that, the park management was impeccable, as you expect from Disney, and we had absolutely no problems at all. One suggestion to Disney would be to perhaps have a separate ticket for the shows exclusively.",Disneyland_HongKong

Now I not saying that all of the food is bad but the hamburgers can stand improvment and why did they take away the stand that sold Mc Donalds fries?

We have visited before and have to say things seemed a bit run down of this occasion however this did not ruin our stay at all. We understand that renovations have to be undertaken however there seemed to be a vast amount of green panels cornering off numerous rides and areas this time. On top of this we came across numerous  technical difficulties  during our stay which resulted in ride closures. This can be difficult to explain to young children particularly after queuing for over half an hour on three occasions!!

As veterans of WDW Orlando, it is impossible to visit Paris without making comparisons. Unfortunately on almost every comparison, Paris came second. Please do not take this as being a negative review as we had a great time, but we did feel their were a number of areas which could be done better. We feel that most of the improvements could be done by better management. Some of the cast member practises and attitudes could be improved, but I believe that is down the management giving a lead and setting the level of service that they find acceptable. People smoking all over the park for example. It is for management to emphasis to cast members that this is unacceptable and for them then to enforce the designated smoking area policy. There are many examples of this type of thing. However these are the issues that drop the resort fro 5 star to 4 star in my opinion, they certainly should not put anyone off experiencing what is a wonderful holiday",Disneyland_Paris
468832396,3,2017-3,United States,"Had a decent time still as it is the magic of Disney but the crowds are becoming intolerable. Everything in the park runs seamlessly in terms of cleanliness and service except when it comes to crowds. We went on a Sunday and there were parts of the park where foot traffic came to a halt for extended periods of time. In the 8 hours we were there, I was hit by 3 strollers and 1 electric wheelchair! I don't know why Disney doesn't at least assign some if it's many staff to help manage crowd control and direction of traffic if they are going to jam the parks to the brim. We were only able to go on 5 rides even with Fast Passes, making each ride cost $44 each for two people. In the rides where Fast Passes were not available, we waited 40 110 minutes. We were not even allowed throw money at any of the restaurants because they were taking reservations only. While we saw that reservations could be made online the day before, there was nothing to indicate that they were required. When we were able to purchase food from the casual cafes, there was no place to sit. We took our tray to another area where we found half a bench. In addition some popular attractions such as the Matterhorn were closed. Really love the rides and charm that the park has to offer but it's becoming too straining on patience to come here. May just avoid the park altogether next time and only go to Downtown Disney. I'm sure if you planned your trip out on strategic days, reservations, and wait times, ran and pushed people when you could, you would be able to hit some type of agenda in the park even with the crowds. But it is just not worth it for us. It seems you need to be very determined and very well researched on park strategy to come here now. ",Disneyland_California

588168997,5,2017-12,United Kingdom,"I've been travelling to Disneyland Paris with my family since I was two years old. Some may say the last 17 years has given me a nostalgia filled perspective, but I'd like to think it means I can scrutinise all the changes made over the years. As of our last visit, our ages ranged from 9 to 73, so believe me when I say Disneyland really does have something for everyone.We usually spend 4 5 days in the park, travelling to Folkstone on the Sunday, and staying overnight to catch the Eurotunnel early Monday morning. We always stay at the Disneyland Hotel, and whilst I appreciate not everyone can do this, I would definitely recommend staying at an on site hotel. Not only is it easier to get to the park every day, but you can make use of extra magic hours, and receive extra fastpasses if staying in club rooms or standard DLH rooms. Super handy for big rides.Every 'land' within the park completely immerses you in the magic. In Adventureland, you really do feel as though you're lost somewhere on a balmy, tropical island, with the Jolly Roger docked by Skull Rock, and the Swiss Family Robinson tree house towering above you. Frontierland is my personal favourite, as there's a whole story that links all the rides, shops and scenery together, which adds all the more depth to the experience. Our favourite rides (in no particular order) have to be Phantom Manor, Peter Pan's Flight, It's a Small World, Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blast, Pirate's of the Caribbean, and Star Tours. Disneyland Paris also has some of the best stage shows and parades on offer. Mickey and the Magician, which is currently running in the Animagic Theatre in Walt Disney Studios Park, is on par with a West End production. Disney Illuminations is my personal favourite; a light and firework show that projects onto the castle at park closing time. Han Solo saying 'Chewie, we're home' right in the centre of my childhood home away from home brings a tear to my eye every single time.Although I've always heard very mixed opinions, personally speaking, the staff have always been exceptional. My grandma is in a wheelchair, so often we have to enter rides at the exit door in order for staff to properly accommodate. Cast Members are always eager to help, and have always been super friendly and polite in doing so. On our last visit, two women in the queue decided to push past us to sit in our designated seats as I was lifting my grandma in, and the Cast Member had no problem throwing them off the ride and to the back of the queue. Despite my many visits, I have never actually eaten at the restaurants and cafes in the park proper. Usually, if you fill up enough at breakfast in your hotel, you can be tied over until dinner time, with maybe a few snacks. Because we always visit in the winter, the park is closed by 7pm, so we've always dined over in Disney Village, which has some remarkable restaurants, as well as some that are hit or miss. I would definitely recommend Annette's Diner, Rainforest Cafe and King Ludwig's.So, in short; excellent rides, fantastic shows; book a Disney Hotel to get the most out of your stay; avoid weekends and half term. There's not much else I can really say   it really is the most magical place on earth.",Disneyland_Paris

Liked the addition to the Jungle Boat Cruise. Big Thunder Mtn Railroad is a fave! Space Mountain and the Star Tours are always a thrill. We had lunch at the Blue Bayou Restaurant where you can see the Pirates of the Carribean tour boats pass by. For 3 of us it cost $127.00 for the moderately priced items. The food was absolutely scrumptious and the waitress's were so very attentive and bright! As a child we visited Disney on a weekly basis! When they had the ticket books with the rides that went by alpha letters from A  the most boring to E  The most exciting! We grew up here and love coming back as much as possible. We purchased other food items throughout the park and not including the restaurant, the food was not that great. When you $6.49 for a baked potatoe and its cold they need to kick up their serving technique.Still love Disney!",Disneyland_California
630671601,5,2018-10,United Kingdom,"Took my 3 year old to Disney, and the place is magical!!!! There was plenty to do over the 3 days we was there. She loved the rides and the magic of Disney. I just have 1 complaint and that is about the Queues for them. Surely there is a better way than making children wait for over an hour to ride?? Overall the experience is brilliant, the parades were amazing and we. And wait to return. ",Disneyland_Paris

They know how to train their cast members and they know how to show you a good time. The new Star Tours is incredible. My husband loves Star Wars but never really liked the old Star Tours. Loves this one. Yes, their prices are outrageous for things, but overall, we had a wonderful time. My husband is having some trouble walking and goes with a cane. They are so kind and caring about everyone. We went during the week so we wouldn't have huge lines and we were lucky in that respect. But even if you do stand in long queues, they always make it entertaining. So much fun. Loved Lincoln, Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Indiana Jones, etc. etc.",Disneyland_California

Andby the way, if they say the park shuts at 23pm, well a part of it shuts earlier if there are fireworks that night is what they dont tell you. not that youll want to be there long enough. The food is bad quality, overpriced and you will be queuing for half an hour in the least. I could keep going but id rather just forget..so expensive to go in too!

443271383,5,2016-12,Australia,"We took the MTR to Sunny Bay station then caught the Disneyland train (make sure you purchase a ticket for this part of the journey). The train has Mickey Mouse shaped windows and statues of Disney characters. It's a great way to start the day. We visited on a Tuesday and arrived just before 10am. There was only one couple in front of us purchasing tickets so we didn't have to wait. We bought two day passes as we knew we'd need more than one day to see most things. Although you're inside the park they don't open the 'worlds' until 10:30am. We started with a couple of the rides and only had to wait a maximum of 10 minutes. No need to get the fast passes for the Hyperspace Mountain ride but it's still worth getting them in case it gets busy later. We saw the Lion King stage show which was excellent. The park offers plenty of different dining options. The food quality was OK but overpriced for what they served. Don't take your own food though as they'll confiscate it before you enter the park. There's lots of different retail outlets selling everything Disney but make sure you're prepared for the high prices. The mine cart ride at Grizzly Gulch is the fastest and most exciting ride. We re visited two days later in the afternoon after spending the morning at the cable car (they're on the same MTR line and one station from each other). We did most of the rides again, more shopping and stayed for the night parade. I didn't think that would impress me but it was worth staying for. As part of the Christmas theme they had fake snow falling from some of the roofs on Main Street which was a nice touch. We decided to beat the crowds and left before the fireworks at 8pm (seen one firework and seen them all!). This turned out to be a good move as the Disney train was only half full and everyone got a seat. The MTR back into Hong Kong was very busy both days. The Ironman ride was still under construction and the RC Racer ride was under repair (December 2016). If you want to go on the circular train ride the last train runs at 4pm (as we discovered at 4:01pm). Plenty of things to do for the young and young at heart.",Disneyland_HongKong
458605828,3,2017-2,Canada,"This was our 2nd trip to Disneyland with out two children. The first trip was 3 years ago when our kids were 7 years old, in July   poor decision. It was super hot and the lines wait times were ridiculous.We decided to do a Disney Do Over. Now that our kids are 10 years old we thought this would be a more reasonable age for them to go and enjoy all that is Disney. We opted to go in February this time thinking it would be far less hot and far less people.The temperature was definitely better although apparently it rains far more than Californians let on. No biggie, we are from Victoria so a little rain is just a regular day for us. The lines were decent without ridiculous line ups like we had experienced when visiting in the summer. Our only gripe was the amount of times rides broke down! Omg. We went on the haunted mansion 5 times and it broke down every single time. Space mountain broke down twice, Alice in wonderland ride was closed for basically 2 days, big thunder mountain broke down, mad hatter tea cups was closed (not scheduled refurbs). Maybe we just had bad luck as it seemed like every time we headed for a ride it was either broken down and closed or broke down while we were on it.Also pirates of the Caribbean was closed the entire 5 days for refurbishments and Matterhorn bobsleds was closed for refurb on day 2 for the remainder of our 5 days.We were aware of this prior to visiting but it still sucked.We were there Friday   Tuesday and Friday night, Saturday and Sunday were extremely busy (summertime busy) but Friday during the day, Monday and Tuesday were amazing with barely any wait times. We had 1 magic morning which we took advantage of (only good for Thursdays, Saturdays and Tuesdays) on the Tuesday (our last day) and were shocked to learn the Magic Morning is only good for rides in Tomorrowland & Fantasyland   Silly us, we thought it was good for the whole park and we tried to head for Indiana Jones ...The park is definitely overpriced in my opinion. Our 5 day park hopper tickets were like $1200 USD which seems pretty out of reach for the average family. Overall visiting Disney in February was great for less people, shorter lines wait times and mild temperatures but not the best for having the  fun  rides all operating and seemed a lot broke down this visit and the ticket cost is the same.",Disneyland_California

Not great but okay. You have a choice of 4 burgers and have a set meal.We had alook round the shops and watched a very short mini parade which featured 2 floats and some dancers.

From the initial unorganized entrance to the park to the lack of cast members available, it was a let down. Lots of areas in the park were under renovation while we were there, and there was nothing to make up for it. We were there the Monday before Easter and the crowds were terrible. And let   s add to the fact that visitors to this park will cut you in line and skip through the lines and not blink an eye, super annoying. They do this for all lines. We waited in line for Big Thunder mountain for 40 min only to be abruptly told to get out of line. Apparently the ride broke and that was it. No further explanation, no sorry, nothing. The very few cast members we encountered were unfriendly, unhelpful, and did not have any    Disney    magic. We love Disney and have been visiting the parks annually for the past 11 years.

The average wait time for a ride was 10 15 minutes, compared to an hour at the other Disney Parks.There was a lot to do. We spent a day there and barely got through the whole park. The park consists of seven parts (Main St. USA, Adventureland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, Toy Storyland, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland). The most congested area was Fantasyland. All the kids were running around having a blast. This is where the Dumbo ride, Teacup ride, and It's A Small World ride is located. I didn't get a chance to go on the Winnie The Pooh ride, bummer. They have a show called Mickey's Philhar Magic. It's a must see. We ate at the Royal Banquet Hall in this section and the food was good. The combo meals will run you about $20US. It's your standard fare (noodles, curry, sushi, pizza, etc.) The pizza and sushi are shaped as a mouse head. This section is also where you can get your pics taken with Mickey and Minnie.Adventureland is where you can take the Jungle River Cruise. This is also where they have the Festival of the Lion King. It's a scaled down version of the musical, The Lion King. The production was on point. I loved the props and costumes.Main St. USA is where you'll find a ton of shops and eateries. At the end of the night, they host the light parade and the fireworks show. The light parade starts at 7:45pm and the fireworks show starts at 8:30pm. Space Mountain, Orbitron, and Jedi Knight rides can be found at Tomorrowland.The Grizzly Gulch is Wild West themed. There's the Geyser Gulch and the Gold Mine Roller Coaster.Mystic Point has the Mystic Manor ride. Be sure to go on this ride. It's super cool and fun. It has a lot of spooky stuff, but it's not scary. Pay attention to the pictures on the walls. I'll leave it at that and won't ruin it for you.Toy Storyland was my least favorite. It's definitely a spot for kids. It has a kids play area and some rides. My eight year old son liked this section.My favorite thing that I did here all day was see the Mickey's Philhar Magic show. It runs about 10 minutes and it's fabulous. You go into this huge theater and they show this short film on the giant screen. It's of various Disney characters singing their songs. It's in 3D and the theatrics are superb. When the Little Mermaid came on, you could feel light sprinkles of water getting splashed on you. When they redid that food scene from Sleeping Beauty, you could smell the cinnamon apple pie. This production is crazy. Do not miss it.",Disneyland_HongKong

The park itself is beautiful and wee maintained and has a lot to offer families. As a single, it was good too, they have special lines so you can be filler on some of the rides which can be a shorter wait time. There is a food offer at the ticket booth for lunch, dinner and a snack and saves you quite a bit of money in that area. All in all, a very enjoyable experience!",Disneyland_HongKong
568396761,4,2018-3,United States,Yes Park is small and underwhelming but the rides themselves are more often than not as good or better than Disney Orlando which I   ve Been to 20 times as they are newer and more modern takes:Everything is scaled down ..Main Street ..Castle (which is actually a bit of a sad attempt ..almost a paper cutout effect)Again park is small an underwhelming but worth a day is you have time to knock it off your Disney. bucket list,Disneyland_HongKong

I liked  sailing with pirates, explore exotic jungle cruse, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad,  Indiana Jones Adventure, and Pirates of the Caribbean",Disneyland_California
157030393,4,2013-4,United States,"I have been to Disneyland countless times but have to say I've been disappointed with the higher ticket prices and annual passes. Disneyland has always been clean and efficient and have top notch rides and shows but is it really worth $125 per person when it is extremely crowded and they continue to gouge you for money once you are inside the park? I don't think so. Be prepared to spend a lot of money if you are visiting the parks and make sure this won't break your budget. Once you are there, enjoy the fun and try not to get upset with the crowds. Disneyland is really the best for amusement parks. It is just the price to enjoy the day with your family that must be taken into account. Have a magical day!",Disneyland_California
209719727,3,2014-5,United Kingdom,"The commercials show fountains, numerous rides and loads of costumed characters . . . Hang on, let's be positive first. My wife, 11 year old daughter and I visited on Sunday 25th May. The weather was beautiful and the first impressions when we walked in were, 'Wow! there has been no expense spared in building this place, it does look really magical'. It was exceptionally clean and colourful. There were many attractions but mainly aimed at younger children and there were numerous eating places to suit all pockets. We particularly liked the 'Hakuna Matata' fast food and salad bar, especially with the African skin drum players playing near by. The Robinson's tree house was amazing. The Riverboat ride was very pleasant and relaxing. And the family oriented 'do not miss' Mad Hatter's Teacup ride was a laugh. We did come across, by chance, some of the 'dancing parades' and they were quite spectacular. So overall the day was enjoyable and reasonable value for money.Now for the disappointment. There weren't as many 'thrill' rides as we thought there would be (only 4) and one of those (Indiana Jones Temple of Peril) was closed and seemed to have been for some time. Also closed was the Pirates Beach and Captain Nemo's Submarine. Walking around the park there didn't seem to be as much going on as there should have been. The fountains weren't working and we only saw 1 Horse Drawn Carriage all day! But the biggest disappointment, especially for my daughter, was . . . THE COMPLETE LACK OF DISNEY CHARACTERS! We went to the 'meet and great' places numerous times but to no avail. The one thing that stands out on the TV adverts is the Mickey and Donald characters waving and speaking to children. Where were they???? On reflection we should have complained but I doubt it would have done much good. It was a good day   a day to remember but not all for the right reasons.It might be well worth checking what is and isn't on before you visit and make sure you ask for a programme as you enter   they don't give you one as a matter of course.",Disneyland_Paris
309469113,5,2014-10,Australia,Its a great place for a family. Theres the best rides and attractions. It has great fireworks display. Great for kids i love the place and would go back again lots to do.,Disneyland_California
538983256,4,2017-11,United Kingdom,Loved this park and can   t wait to come back. A few things annoyed me were.. smokers! I seen so many people walking round the park smoking and not even in the smoking areas. This included the viper smoking things. This is not fair on people who do not smoke. Also I seen so many people with selfie sticks. And didn   t see one cast member stopping the smokers or the selfie sticks. I know in Florida that the cast members are on top of things like this. ,Disneyland_Paris
