19343,269413664,5,missing,Australia,"Just fantastic, what a place. We loved it. 2.5 days was about enough with a 7 and 3 y.o and we saw all that we had hoped. Use fast pass carefully to get at the big kid rides. Parade at 4pm was simply magic.",Disneyland_California
30193,594099257,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,"By far the most magical place in the world your sure to have the time of your life. It   s Like entering a new world, the cast members are brilliant the shows and rides are fantastic and the fireworks are out of this world and the park it   s self is absolutely jaw droppingly beautiful. You will make memory   s that will last a life time x",Disneyland_Paris
13609,452913542,4,2016-12,Canada,Disneyland is definitely fun for the whole family. It was busier than usual this visit. I need thing I learned was don't bother rely on answers given by park members   90% of the time incorrect info was given   I have been told it is because cast members are not allowed to say they don't know...personally I find incorrect info much more frustrating than them not knowing : ,Disneyland_California
31823,497670845,5,2017-6,United Kingdom,"I loved every second! Very friendly staff, lots to do and perfect for the young or young at heart. It's best to get to rides places early as the lines get long quickly but there are signs outside and the app to help with queue times. The illuminations were amazing and a perfect way to end the day and the parade was really good especially the dragon. We really enjoyed frontierland and fantasyland, the food there was really good.We will definitely be returning ",Disneyland_Paris
5651,295186826,4,2015-7,Philippines,"The Disneyland experience with my wife was a dream come true. She is an avid Mickey fan since birth while i loved Donald Duck and its machine gun talking and voice. It was more fulfilling having pictures taken with Mickey, seeing him in flesh. We booked on line promising discount and to avoid the long queue, one day ride all package for php2500 . The day we alloted to it was worth it though it was short. We never witnessed the 9pm fireworks display as we have limited time trip only in Hongkong. For sure with kids, one day is not enough. Experiencing the Disney Fun brought out the child once more in us. Mickey was everywhere, that familiar shape  in souvenir items, jewelries, gardens, breads, tshirts, and even train windows. We rode the Carousel, watched the Mickey and Donald Duck 3D show which was hilarious and double the fun than the rides.We were also awed touring the Small World.As much as we wanted to ride more, the queued got even longer past 2pm.To get there, take the Tung Chung line and get off from Sunnybay station and wait for the Mickey train which adds excitement and sets already the Disney atmosphere. However, we found the food bit pricey and the water to drink cost us $30 ( php 150 ) for 1 500ml. Later, we would find potable water fountain, The souvenir shops are also selling pricey Tshirts ( php 1,200 ), etc. However, we got what we liked at bargained price, half its original price. I am not sure if that was just coincidence.",Disneyland_HongKong
28050,120221747,5,2011-9,Australia,"The happiest place on earth. Had 3 wonderful days of entertainment and fun. Try and organise your day with fast passes to the most popular attractions, otherwise just 'wing it' and enjoy. We have been to Disneyland twice, at off peak tourist times, and the crowds are not so bad during the week.",Disneyland_California
36750,259310341,5,2015-3,United Kingdom,"First time visit to Disneyland Paris, though have been to Disney World Orlando, so knew what to expect. Wanted to treat our grandson to his first Disney trip, and would definitely return (with without him). Not all rides have the fastpass option, but make good use of those with that option to make the best use of your time. This is a FREE service, just scan your park ticket at the designated machine and return within the allocated time.If staying on site you get early access to the park, but plan your day so you don't get tuckered out and miss the lasers. The hotels are easily accessible on foot and comp shuttles run until 11.30pm. You might like to head back to hotel part way thru the day for an hour and return to catch the laser show. Laser show is worth the wait, but get a good spot where no one can block your view.",Disneyland_Paris
42077,100850925,3,2011-3,United Kingdom,"I visited Disneyland Paris 2 weeks after it first opened in 1992 and it was chaotic, but great fun. We also visited it again a couple of years later, when it had changed from Euro Disney to Disneyland Paris and apart from the staff being a LOT less friendly it was still good.But this time, oh dear! How run down it has all got! Broken paving all over the place, the HSE would shut this place down in a heartbeat if it was located in the UK. Algae growing over the rides, and the hard landscaping crumbling and poorly kept.Unlike California or Florida, there are absolutely no characters in the park, unless you count the machine gun carrying gendarmes ( Daddy, why are those men carrying machine guns? ). It was very cold, so we bought a  tigger suit  from one of the Disney shops for our 14 month old   he did look very cute and lots of people asked for a photo with him   that was the closest to any characters in the park that day!We're Disney junkies and have been to the 2 US parks many times. We know it's a machine to extract the maximum money, but the quid pro quo is that the park operators give you a really good Disney themed time. The magic is lacking at Disneyland Paris   it just feels like a run down theme park. If you can manage it go to Orlando or Anaheim   they are in an entirely different league.",Disneyland_Paris
40107,152847910,4,2013-2,United Kingdom,"I have previously attended Disneyword in American so was a bit unsure about coming to this park. Although I did not realize I was in Paris as it is exactly the same. The ques for the rides went down very quick as we used fastpasses for most of the rides. Space Mountain at 2pm was only a 10 minutes ques. The parade was shown every 30 minutes which was great all the main Disney Characters were dancing around and even saw a special appearance from Clarice with Chip and Dale. The food is very expensive in this park so please be aware. Take your own drinks in as its 3 euros for a bottle of coke and 7 euros for a hot do at Caseys Corner. However this is very nice. The parks are very clean and lots of cast members are walking around the park each day. All rides were open apart from Pirates of the Caribbean which was getting refurbished and is closed throughout April. The only bad thing about this park and Walt Disney Studios is that there is no cast members with any characters. The characters are left to walk alone for them selves which I find very bad. So if you want your children to meet the characters book a meal at Cafe Mickey. Although some arnt such as Mickey, Buzz light year and Aladdin. This park is amazing and I cant wait to go back :)",Disneyland_Paris
180,654875575,4,2018-12,United Kingdom,"First time I've been to Disneyland, so I have no benchmark for comparison. Smaller than I expected, but big enough to fill a full day for two adults. Lots of fun to be had, though some of the rides are aimed at children, so don't be disappointed if you're too big to fit on them. The Disney train was very cool, and had a real air of excitement...Join Mickey and Minnie for the day and enjoy :)",Disneyland_HongKong
23076,183442042,5,2013-8,United States,As a Disney fan it is always fabulous visiting the original park and I am never disappointed by the impeccable service and variety of activities that you can do at the park.,Disneyland_California
24112,165059233,2,2013-6,Saudi Arabia,"We got there early in the morning at 9 am and we left at 12 am at midnight. It was really crowded like judgement day. I did not like the fact to stand up for hours to watch a parade or a show. I think Disney management should consider controlling park entry and population by not allowing park population to exceed certain number on a given day, through paid reservations. Food was extremely expensive and not too many choices. I enjoyed Disney World better last time I was there 4 years back. I wont advice, but good luck.",Disneyland_California
27696,122884877,5,2011-12,Canada,"Our family of 5 visited Disneyland over the Christmas period, and we had a wonderful time! The crowds were quite heavy, but we managed to see all the attractions by utilizing the Fastpass system. Every morning 4 of us would head to a ride while the other went to get a Fast Pass for one of the big rides (Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones, or Splash Mountain). This seemed to worked quite effectively. As soon as we were able to, we went to get another Fast Pass.On our first day there, we unfortunately left our camera in one of the restroom stalls, and in a panic headed to lost & found. We were informed to check back with them the following day, as it would not have been brought down to them yet. They informed me that Disney has a 96% return rate on lost items. I was doubtful thought that I would ever receive it. However, the next day, I went to lost & found and it was there! I was absolutely thrilled with the service, and thankful to the good samaritan or Cast Member who turned it in.All in all, we had a fantastic time   the food was good, yes expensive, but we expected that. The reservation system for dining was excellent   and you can reserve 60 days prior to arrival.",Disneyland_California
7183,206456066,5,2014-5,India,"The park is beautifully made. It is maximum fun for kids to meet the disney characters. The rides are also nice and mostly small kids can also enjoy them. Sleeping beauty castle is amazing and do not miss the ride through the castle. The festival of lion king at the adventureland is very good. Please note the timing of shows beforehand so as not to miss them. The disney parade is impressive. Make sure you get your position atleast 30min before as the public lines up in the front very early and the view might get blocked for the small kids. To enjoy the park I recommend 1 day atleast or may be 2 days. It cannot be done in half day with kids. You can greet the charcters and click photos but the waiting time is around 20 min for very popular ones like micky, minnie or pooh. for others it is little less.Fellow Indians you will get very good vegetarian indian food at the tahitian terrace restaurant at the adventureland.We missed the fireworks as it got cancelled due to weather conditions.",Disneyland_HongKong
26064,137088597,5,2012-8,United States,We went to Disneyland for my Daughter's 4th Birthday and everyone there made her feel so special. She was so excited and happy to be there. All day long everyone kept giving her High 4 and telling her Happy Birthday! She thought that Disnelyand was bulit just for her.,Disneyland_California
31484,518615027,5,2017-8,United Arab Emirates,"That's more than a park, and it is very suitable for everybody in every age!Kids will enjoy the realistic cartoons and adults will enjoy watching their memories LIVE.You can go by Paris Metro very easily, takes about 40 minutes from Saint Michel metro station to arrive.Enjoy!Important Notes:1  there are 2 parks, do not be late so you can enjoy both (one is more for the adults I believe)2  There is a fireworks show starting at 11 pm every night, do not miss it, it is much more than what you expect.3  They told us that the metro works till 12:30, but the last train left 12:15 and we missed it, other ways back to Paris is not as suitable as Metor. Taxi is very expensive and the Night bus takes about 2 hours to arrive Paris downtown. DO NOT MISS THE RETURN METRO!Enjoy",Disneyland_Paris
18946,279382076,5,2015-6,United States,We stayed in the California Grand. Very cool building. The best part is that you walk right into California Adventure park. Or you walk right on to Downtown Disney. My kids loved the bunk beds. The pool has a waterslide and there are 3 different pools to play or swim in.,Disneyland_California
21540,217070675,4,2014-7,United States,"We got to the park at 8:00. It was quiet & cool. 1 hour later it was packed & hot! We still had a great time (how could you not???) but if there is a next time, we'll go in the late fall to avoid the heat & crowds.",Disneyland_California
24093,165316051,5,2013-6,United States,"I have been to Disneyworld several times but this was my first trip to Disneyland. There was so many things to enjoy. We were their when the gates opened and got to accomplish so much in the first hour. By nine, we were in Toontown and we practically had the place to ourselves. There was no line for Mickey, Minnie and Goofy and Pluto to take pictures and get autographs. Space mountain is awesome. They changed the one in Disneyworld and its not as great as it used to be. Here, you are still in the dark and it gives it such a thrill, had to ride it twice. Did get to ride to famous Matterhorn. Haunted Mansion is the same. Pirates Carribean is better in Florida. Fantasmic is about the same. I was disappointed with the Indiana Jones ride, didn't see what the hype was and it broke down while we were on it. The best thing was during the last hour Fantasyland is virtually empty and you can walk onto all the rides with hardly any wait. It was a long day but very worth the wait.",Disneyland_California
17694,309966481,5,2015-9,United States,"What's not to love? It was great to see all the Diamond Celebration events and special touches. We always have a great time whenever we visit Disneyland!

29625,629070503,5,2018-10,Italy,"Cleaner, more walking space, greener, some rides have different forms of endings or circuits, and most rides are cleaner newer. The only downside here, is some things are in French, including the firework show.And the food and service is extremely slow and the food isnt that great.

37641,225941090,5,2014-8,United Kingdom,"My Wife and I took our twin seven year old children to Disneyland Paris in August, a holiday we figured we could never afford, however, how wrong were we....First things first, Disneyland Paris is absolutely Amazing, all of it, every inch, in plain sight or not . What I mean by this is the attention to detail is unreal in all areas, even in the shops or restaurants, if you don't look up or in the corners your missing out on more figures jokes displays or just plain things of interest. The Park is spotless all the time, in fact I do not remember seeing any litter at any time. The staff patrolling the Park are friendly and helpful and will take the time to chat and help in any way they can.There is something for all ages, 0 99 , a massive range of rides and shows all day long, enough restaurants and food carts to please every palate and wallet. Now down to the facts, we booked our Hotel & Travel separately , by doing this we saved a fortune. If you book with the Disney Site you will get the best deal on a Disney Hotel, and this is where you will want to stay because it comes with added benefits . If you stay in a Disney on site Hotel you can book a table and eat in every restaurant, something you cant do if you stay outside or off resort, believe me Caf   Mickey is one of these and is one you wont want to miss if you want to meet the Characters, we booked for Breakfast and the experience made our Holiday, the twins met, cuddled, got autographs and pictures with seven characters all of which took time with each table and made everyone feel very special...The other benefit is the Disney Extra Hours , being able to get into the Park from 8am instead of 10am is a massive bonus, especially if there are any rides or experiences you really want to try out before everyone else is let in later on..A stroll through Disney Village takes you to the Park or Disney Studios avoiding the main entrance gate where the queues are pretty large just to get in..There are restaurants to suit every taste and budget, most kids can get 3 courses for 15 euro or less so about   12, adults anywhere from 11 euro up to 50 80 euro.. I would not recommend a food package as we found it cheaper to pay ourselves, our average family of four meal was around 60 euro, with a drink.. however we did spoil ourselves one night and dined at The Blue Lagoon Restaurant which is part of The Pirates of The Caribbean Ride , amazing food and service and spent 120 euro..We stayed at the Cowboy Village   Hotel Cheyenne listed as one of the ``Budget`` options however we found it more than suitable and the kids loved it, breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded however the food is help yourself continental so fill up for the day.. We found it quiet on a night and had no problem leaving a window open if needed.Down side ??? ... It`s very busy with people from all over the world, some of which don't understand the concept of waiting in line,,,, LOL .. However when your in line there are usually fences either side of you ..a hand on either side tends to sort this problem out.One thing not to miss ...The Disney Dreams Night Time Show On The Castle.. if you and your little ones can stay awake as it starts at 11pm during the summer.. it is absolutely Amazing and lasts about thirty minutes with fireworks, lasers and a story projected on the castle and fountains.We will be going back again.....",Disneyland_Paris

34473,351421320,5,2016-2,United States,"Disney!! Visited mid winter break   not too crowded but it was cold!! We had a blast!! If you go for more than 3 days   get the Disney Dream Passport!!! It's good for all year and you get the benefits of discounts of souveniers and food!!!The lines were not too long, but there were closures of rides for refurbishment for next years 25th anniversary.",Disneyland_Paris
21465,218532948,4,2014-7,United Kingdom,"Overall a great place, but lacks the light parade which Florida now has. There was a little queuing for the big rides like space mountain but for these you are able to get fast passes.",Disneyland_California
28580,81761248,2,missing,Finland,"All the rides are for 5 10 years old children. And I was expecting something more, I have seen so many better amusement parks. I would recommend Disneyland only for children under the age of 10. I hope we had not gone there, because it took the whole day, but I had no idea... : ",Disneyland_California
37259,239695929,4,2014-8,United Kingdom,"We spent a week in this area, visiting 'the park' for 3 days and using the rest of the time to explore Paris and the local area. The park was a lot of fun and very similar to Florida in terms of the rides and d  cor. We enjoyed the buzz around the 20 years celebrations and the additional parades etc. Food and drinks were expensive in the park, but there are shopping centres etc close by to get provisions before you go into the park.Allow time for park security   it takes along time to get through the checks! Make use of fast passes and complain if rides break down and you've queued for some time as you can often get extra fast passes to jump the queue next time. Travel to and from the park was easy with frequent shuttle buses and trains. The Disney team were helpful.... but not quite as cheery as the American's are.....",Disneyland_Paris
6180,262826478,5,2014-4,India,"I had went to Disney land in 2012 june it was a really a great experience all the rides and 3d,4d shows are wonderfull  it was not easy to see it in one  day  it is amazing",Disneyland_HongKong
20465,239730237,4,2014-9,United States,"Expensive to get in, expensive to park, expensive to spend the day. But, it is a wonderful experience and fun environment! We have been to both Disney World and Disneyland. Disneyland is a bit older and appeared to us to be a bit more 'worn'. We visited the first week of September and the lines were not bad. Most of the attractions we waited about 10   15 minutes. One attraction was about 20 minutes, but that was the longest. Even though we arrived first thing in the morning and the wait lines were not that long, we still were not able to visit all the attractions in one day. There are many to see! We are all adults and did not have any children, so it was easier for us to get around, still, we could not visit and see everything in one day. If you have children, go early and have a plan, otherwise you may not get much in. Go off season. Don't go in the summer when the place is crowded, unless you enjoy waiting in line and mixing with crowds. We have visited Disney World in both the summer and in the off season, so we suspect the crowds and experience would be similar in Disney Land. If you want to see the parade, get on the parade route early. Even in September when the crowds were lesser, the parade route was packed and deep. TIPS   . get there 30 minutes before the gates open, so you can be the first in. Immediately Ask an employee when you go into the park what he she suggests you go to first. Move quickly the first two hours to get in as many attractions as possible. HAVE A PLAN! Use the first two three hours to see as much as possible before others arrive. Don't dawdle in the morning at the hotel and arrive mid  late morning. Get the to park EARLY! The lockers are available for a fee (of course it is a high fee! But, it can free up your hands for items you do not want to carry all day).",Disneyland_California
28,669353396,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,We visited here on a Wednesday. We arrived for opening and found the queue times to be short and had done most the rides we wanted to by early afternoon. Unfortunately there were no fireworks due to the castle being renovated and we have seen many parades at Disney world so we decided not to stay for the evening. ,Disneyland_HongKong
38855,185406138,4,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Been 3 times to this park   once with 5 year old, once with 5 and 11 year old and once with 11 year old   The park is large enough for 2 days intense or 3 days leisurely exploring, but be warned the food is SO expensive. Best way to do trip is stay at a hotel off park and buy food to take in for the day. The rides for the littlies are brill, and the rides and attractions for the older kids are also brill, but all come with long queues. If you can   do the really big rides later on in the evening   one of the major roller coasters only had a 10 min wait at 8pm, as opposed to over an hour during the day. My last visit was in October 2013 and although it was good   4 of the roller coasters broke down whilst we were in the queue, showing that the attractions are getting old. We particulally liked the car show and the other cinema shows   a little change from queuing and fast rides   and a chance to have a short foot rest! I went with Gold Crest Coaches and the whole experience was not short of exceptional   the organisation and the efficiency of the drivers was brilliant   I would thoroughly recommend them. As an extra we had a further day in paris at the end which was well worth the money and we loved every minute.",Disneyland_Paris
38666,191243100,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"We visited in September then again in December for Christmas. It was my first time visiting after wanting to go since being a little child! Disneyland passed all my expectations and I really miss it now. Even as an adult the characters are happy to have photos with you and I must have been the only adult with an autograph book. There was little queues as we visited mid week both times. The parades are our favourite part, the characters have so much energy very time. I can only say good things about Disneyland!",Disneyland_Paris
22196,204161235,4,2014-4,United States,I found that Disneyworld is much better than Disneyland. Disneyland is too small to accommodate the crowds as well as Disneyworld. When we visited last week I was always afraid that I would lose my grandchild as we couldn't move about as easy as in Florida. But I would go there again and again as it is fun!,Disneyland_California
2658,463118979,5,2017-2,United Kingdom," Enjoyed every second of it, made me feel like a kid again. As it was my first visit to Disneyland as an adult bought the kid out of me.

Nice rides and a full day of fun guaranteed. ",Disneyland_HongKong
26373,133516201,5,2012-7,United States,Used the single rider line as often as possible and at times was faster than the fastpass lines.  The Fantasmic show was amazing as well as the 4th of July fireworks!  Enjoyed the comedy show near thundermountain railroad.,Disneyland_California

30671,566599683,5,2018-3,United Kingdom,Just returned from three days at the Park. Busier than expected for this time of year so be prepared to queue for the popular rides. We made use of the early entry facility we had with staying at a Disney hotel but as most rides didn   t seem to open until 10 am anyway seemed a bit pointless unless you want coffee or shops with less crowd. Some attractions were closed for refurbishment which was a disappointment but expected before peak season but we had plenty to do and still didn   t manage to do or see everything we wanted to. Highly recommend the evening show with fireworks. Think my favourite thing ,Disneyland_Paris
32078,482620873,5,2017-5,Ireland,Besides the magical experience i was more impressed with how children with special needs are treated. No queuing up for rides which helps a lot as a parent or career. Even down to the meet and greet and the shows Disney makes it hassle free. Other parks should learn from this. I was well impressed. ,Disneyland_Paris
14862,399422712,4,2016-7,Australia,A very hectic fast paced park we spent 2 whole days here and still didn't do and see everything a fast pass is a must we didn't have one so missed a lot of stuff my husband hated it too many people I dealt with it but the 13yr old enjoyed most of it,Disneyland_California
30653,567733551,2,2018-3,United Kingdom,"We enjoyed the parade and the fireworks at the end. However, the standards were not what we expected at all! Most rides are very old and you can tell that they have not been chanced from 20 years ago! Most of them are for very young children, there are only a couple of them for adults. all restaurant were understaff and even if everyone was very nice, you could tell they were tired and overworked. Also, I am allergic to gluten and I could not find a single restaurant that could serve me gluten free food! I would have expected better from a place that sees so many people every day of the year! Overall is a nice day out, however I would not come back every again (not even with kids!)",Disneyland_Paris
21200,225371036,5,2014-8,Australia,"Disneyland a place of plastic dreams. Yes Disney is fun and everyone should go if they can. Stay away from the Matterhorn Bobsled ride, its a killer. By the time I crawled out of the sledge with a very sore neck & back I knew I would never ever ride it again, every turn was jarring so if you have bad necks, backs, hips, knees stay away for your own safety's sake. However I love its a small world and there are plenty of other rides to enjoy for all.

20142,247375989,1,missing,United States,"My son wanted to go to disneyland for his birthdsay (Christmas time). Bought three day hoppers for my kids and I. Went in the first day I bought tickets, place was swarmed like never before. We decide to use the fast track passes and one ticket was not working. Asked 4 different workers and they kept sending me to someone else. Went and stood in line for an hour at guest services on a windy day only to be told I had to go to the front entrance and get my ticket scanned. I went to 4 more different entrance booths and they kept sending me to the next one until I got clearly upset then someone scanned it...it was never scanned at park entrance.Now that we wasted a couple of hours walking from the end of the park to the front and stood in line for an hour only for the buck to be passed around, my son started having trouble with his asthma so we left to the hotel.Unfortunately it was super windy and my son's asthma got worse I called Disneyland several times to explain my son's health issue and to see how or what I needed to do to get the other two days refunded since I couldn't take my son outdoors. All four different times I called every single representative was extremely rude and could care less about my situation. They kept telling me my tickets are not refundable. That is $507.00 extra in two days that we cannot use. They didn't care. They pointed out that it was stated on the tickets they are not refundable. No one has the opportunity to read your policy on your tickets until they are purchased which is then too late. They pointed out that I had 13 days to use them. we extended out hotel stay a couple more days to see if my son's breathing problems would get better costing me more in lodging, mind you it's Christmas time (not cheap season). I was told  well you can come back withing the 13 days  I told them I lived in San Francisco not exactly around the corner. They stuck to their cold monotone rude voice and kept saying  well they are not refundable  I wasted $795.00 on two hours at Disneyland. We usually go to Disneyland twice a year, they lost my business for good for their greed and lack of empathy.Worst customer service experience I've encountered in a long while. Disneyland is not what it used to be. Its all commercialized. Plus nothing special for Christmas which was the reason why my kids wanted to visit during x mas time.",Disneyland_California

40416,144856901,2,missing,United Kingdom,"We visited Disney Land Paris from the 3rd to the 7th of November 2012 with friends. 4 adults 3 kids age 6,4,2. The place could be fantastic but disney are far too interested in making as much money as possible and not looking after there guests!! We were there 4 days and honestly got on 4 rides. Yes 1 per day not bad for the   3500 it cost for a family of 3. You had to que for absolutely everything from the second you walk in to the second you walk out!! Not just rides its toilets,food, drink,absolutely everything. In my honest opinion there was twice as many people in the park that it could manage and give there customers the experience that Disney promises. I will never darken Disneyland Paris door again and do my best to make sure people don't make the same mistake that we did. Save your money and go to Orlando Florida!! You have been warned",Disneyland_Paris
18467,288571975,5,2015-7,United States,"Ist time at Disneyland, I enjoyed it and would go back. First thing get there early go on the rides that might have long lines later, take extra clothing in backpack, we were soaked after splash mountain, try to eat breakfast before going in, then taking a snack and bottled water in the park. Definitly a hat. During the afternoon lines did get long but moved quickly. We didn't do the fast pass but it worked out fine. Get a good seat an hour before the parade maybe grab dinner and sit in a good spot because we had a horrible time finding a spot because we were not there early for the parade, people save to many spots and it took us 45 minutes to find a place to watch parade, it only goes down Main street, and if you can be by the castle, after parade they do the fireworks from the castle. It takes time but find the princesses if you have a child who is crazy about them, they have their own house and the line is not too long. I enjoyed Space Mountain, it was totally awesome. Parking is easy, take a picture of the lot name and number. After fireworks if you are not staying, hurry along to the shuttle line because it gets packed. We only did one day but next time I may do the 2 day pass, we did ride all the popular rides but we ran out of time to ride every ride and I am sure we messed some good ones. I would recommend Disneyland even at my age, I had a blast and did not once get tired, too excited...ENJOY",Disneyland_California

Queued for an hour plus to take photos with characters such as Mickey and Donald.The rides were not as exciting as the ones in Tokyo and Paris. Food there was average too.

10333,619012193,5,2017-12,Australia,We love Disneyland. The original park has a special kind of magic to it that makes it worth visiting even if you're been to the rest.

42080,100309244,3,2011-3,United Kingdom,"We stayed on a Sun deal,   138 for 4 all in with a night in the Cheyenne hotel and whilst I wasn't horrified I was underwhelmed. The room was clean, albeit with a missing bulb and an arm which came off the chair and a bit of mould in the bathroom but these can be overlooked. The beds were comfortable and everything looked fine. The buffet meal in the hotel can only be described as an ordeal in which you feel you are a processed like an overworked singing cartoon. It's a free for all basically and while the food is of average quality there is absolutely no atmosphere in the massive hall, no characters, no music even, just the din of thousands of other diners. Breakfast was even worth with little choice and no hot food except toast from two toasters between what I guessed was at least a thousand people in our sitting (if you can call the endless stream of people a sitting).Anyway, on to the park and after the 500 meter walk from car park to park you find yourself in DLP itself. The wonder of it all does hit you for a while, especially on Main Street, the detail, the realistic look, but then you find that on further inpection that underneath the surface there isn't much to nourish the soul. 90% of the shops sell overpriced merchandise and the other 10% lacklustre and unimaginative food.Then onto the theme parks themselves, Fantasy Land, Frontier Land etc. OK, the rides were realtively good for the late 80s, but come on we are in 2010 now with home entertainment on playstations etc making this fayre of Autopia and Frontier Land looking decidedly dated. OK, many people don't go for the rides, Alton Towers and a dozen others offering more thrilling, but even the heritage is wearing off. Star Tours (a Star Wars lookalike) looks faded and dated (where's the HD or Dolby Surround, or cushion molded seats), and Captain Eo, courtesy of Michael Jackson, this was dated in the 90s before all the scandal, but does an average 8 year old really have any concept of who Michael Jackson was?Then there are all the little things, faded paint on the Carousel, holes on the ride, graffiti in most of the toilets, potholes, poor customer service and staff who would rather point you in the general direction of something than take you there, true disney style, lack of characters walking around.Don't get me wrong it wasn't terrible. Some of the staff were great and for the price we paid, it was a bargain, but I wouldn't make a holiday of it. You honestly get better value for money at Chessington (with the animals to see as well as cheap thrills) or Alton Park.Lets see Disney reinvent its parks for the 21st century, get rid of the old rides and reintroduce some true innovation to beat back all the whipper snappers once again.",Disneyland_Paris

We traveled in February so the crowds would be down and we experienced no really long wait times and that was great. The cast members seemed to go out of their way to make sure our days were perfect.. I was a little disappointed as some of the rides were close for refurbishment, but that was OK... this park after all, is a year round park so things have to be close from time to time.

38209,208164515,2,2014-5,Australia,"Having experienced   and enjoyed   the original Disneyland in Anaheim (and Disney's California Adventure), we decided to add three days onto our European holiday to take our three young children (age 7, 7 and 9) to Disneyland Paris: we now wish we hadn't.It's not that it's terrible   it isn't   it just isn't as Disney would have you believe. The most disappointing aspect was the staff ('cast members'). Where in LA you get the perky, bubbly friendly service   from everyone   that you expect, at Disneyland Paris it felt as if the cast members were there under duress and would rather be somewhere else. There was no sparkle in the eye, no 'going that extra mile'   in fact, most of them were unhelpful at best, or downright rude at worst. Whether we were queuing to get a crepe or for a ride, the cast member we were finally met by rarely managed a smile   even our kids noticed. You can't pitch yourself as 'the happiest place on earth', then have your whole team getting around like the cast of Les Miserable.All the rides we went on were the usual Disney standard   clever animatronics, enchanting, fun etc. No complaints there: except for the ones that regularly stopped in motion   the Buzz Lightyear ride stopped six times while we were on it (that's six times during one ride!). We understand that big parks like this have long queues   we were prepared to wait   but when you saw half empty wagons being sent off, because the cast members weren't doing their jobs to fill the empty seats   it became infuriating. Frankly, the whole place felt mismanaged.Perhaps it was not yet peak tourist season (we went in late May), but to see so many restaurants and food outlets closed made the place look like it was abandoned in part (Frontierland and parts of Adventureland in particular). This, of course, meant the queues at the operating food outlets extended for miles.By the end of our first day, we were so frustrated, we just wanted someone from Disney head office to sweep in and sort the place out: refocus and cheer up the staff; improve the food; and add a lick or two of paint to the numerous scrappy and scummy areas that looked like they haven't had a polish since the park opened over twenty years ago.While our LA experience will be held in our minds forever, we feel so let down that our children's first Disney experience was this half hearted reproduction in France.It's a pity   with a bit of energy and focus, this could easily be as magic a kingdom as the American version (I'm Australian, by the way, so I'm not blowing the American trumpet lightly!).",Disneyland_Paris

I am a Disney fan and a general theme park fan and was excited myself.We will not be returning and will save up for the authentic American experience.DLP was filthy dirty, the staff were rude (we even witnessed a staff member shouting at a tearful girl in a princess dress) and unhelpful. Customer  services  were also hugely unhelpful. Chronically understaffed. Most rides had something broken on them, breaking the spell. Water rides had rubbish floating in them for the three days we were there. Set pieces were either broken or not lit. Thick dust on the exhibits. Staff did not hurray people on and off rides (people were actually taking pictures of themselves in the rides) which led to extreme queues.We booked a Disney hotel so that we could experience  Magic hours  which is access to the park two hours early. What they don't tell you is that they only open 5 rides so that you are in a 30 minute queue at 8.30am with a crying toddler. Deep queues and slow service from everything to rides to restaurant. We had to wait 45 mins even when we had booked. One meal took two hours and when it arrived it was horrible and dried out. Water in the parks is 3.29euros   a scandal. Character breakfast was like a cattle market, one lot shipped out and next one in, dirty table and plates. Food all round was expensive and poor quality. Shuttles to the park were often late and irregular.There was one fantastic waiter in our hotel. it is telling that my son often says he wants to go back to see the waiter, not Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

The size of the park makes it manageable, not just for young children but for older people. best to being camera, umbrella or hat to cover in outdoor exploring activities, and wearing a very comfortable walking shoes is a must. Its good also that we already purchased our ticket (entrance and meals) online to avoid the hassle and queuing lines.

28842,8435437,5,missing,United Kingdom,"We had 3 day park hopper tickets   and put them to good use! Our stay was during the last week of July and we were expecting the park to be heaving with huge queues. We were pleasantly surprised!We arrived at the park at about 7.15 on Monday morning to use some of the early entry our hopper tickets offered. We headed over to Tomorrowland to go on Space Mountain but it wasn't running yet (there seemed to be quite a lot of technical problems with the ride while we were there   one time we were on the ride and instead of turning right at the beginning by the control room, we turned left into a behind the scenes area. We all had to get out, go back to the loading area and wait for them to re set it. We did get to ride a few times over our trip though) so we headed over to Fantasyland while it was quiet as they're the kind of rides which are nice to see, but you don't want to queue a long time for them! (Being a family group of 4 with the youngest aged 21!) We got on a few rides before regular opening which was a good bonus. We expected the queues to steadily build after opening, but we never really encountered any queues more than about 30 minutes throughout the whole 3 days. We put this down to 2 factors: a) good planning and use of fastpasses (more on that in a minute!) and b) Finding Nemo. Everyone seemed to be queueing for Nemo, leaving other major attractions with much reduced waiting times. We had decided that we weren't going to bother queueing for half the day for one attraction when we could experience so much more by avoiding it! We got on loads! This was as well as taking a few hours out in the afternoon to return to our hotel for a swim and a break before heading back for dinner and the evening refreshed. I would really recommend this, as by around 3 the park is really busy and you'll be getting increasingly hot and bothered and so won't really enjoy the rest of the day   plus it's a nice rest for your feet!!We really enjoyed this year being the 'Year of a Million Dreams'   especially as we got lucky every day! On the first day we came across Dream Cast Members giving out limited edition million dreams Mickey Ears, and on the second and third days we got Dream Fastpasses! These were great as not only could we use our fastpasses when a queue was huge, but unlike regular fastpasses it meant that we didn't have to zig zag back and forward to get the fastpass and then go back and use it. These really made our day!We enjoyed Fantasmic again, although some people keep trying to push you of the way which is really annoying!I love Disneyland and am such a big kid!

14030,436553315,3,2016-11,United States,"My family & I visited Disneyland the week of Nov 6 12 with my husband & 2 young children (ages 2.5 & 5). Let me start off by saying I grew up going to Disney World. And visited Disney World with my family in Nov 2014. Every experience at Disney World has been a magical one. We decided to visit Disneyland this year because our visits to Disney World have always been so wonderful historically. We will NEVER come back to Disneyland. We stayed at the Disneyland hotel & took advantage of the  extra magic hour  (select days the park opens an hour early to allow guests who are staying in a Disney property hotel actress to the parks before they open to the public). The image shows the lines for the security checkpoint. This wasn't even the line to get into the parks. Between the security lines & the additional line we had to stand in to get into the park, we waited at least an hour every morning. We missed most if not all of the  magic hour.  The cast members at the park gates were taking pictures of each individual guest who was entering the parks for the 1st time. That slowed down the process for sure. Disney World utilizes magic bands. Hopefully, Disneyland will upgrade their ticket & fastpass technology. That may help with the crowds. My husband suggested increasing their ticket prices substantially. We paid full price for 5 day park hopper tickets & a Disney property hotel. However, we would have paid more to not have to put up with the mass chaos that is Disneyland. Of course, after standing over an hour in line to access the parks, my 2 young daughters were going completely ballistic as you would expect. My husband could not understand how intelligent people would put up with this even if it is Disney. The flow of traffic & amount of people inside the parks was intolerable at times. I gave this park 3 stars instead of 1. Because once you get inside (& hopefully you do) & interact with the characters, it's nice. We had several character meals that were well done. Dear Disneyland, we hope you figure out crowd control. Sadly, our little family will not be back.",Disneyland_California

Though my kids were already 12 years old, it does not mean they can't enjoy. Everybody should be able to enjoy places like disneyland. Because it was hot, we had to be careful not to develop headaches by going in to indoor rides only to go out to the blistering heat, although we couldn't avoid it. As you spend more of your time outdoor than indoor, just make sure you drink lots of water. As expected, the lines at the drinking stations at the toilets were long!Some of the rides were old. For example, autopia should be changed already. Some of the rides are classic. And some were recently added, though small.

33602,394879969,4,2016-7,United States,"We visited Disneyland Paris over a very hot weekend in July. We have been to Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida dozens of times over the years. Disney Paris seemed like a combination of these two U.S. parks but on a much smaller scale. It was fun to go on rides that had similar names to the U.S. parks, yet they were much different. The Space Mountain ride was much more intense with loops and twists than the California & Florida versions, however it is not nearly as smooth as the U.S. versions, your head kind of bobs around. Also the Indiana Jones ride is very different than the U.S, it's actually a roller coaster! Our favorite rides were in Hollywood Studios, the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster and Tower of Terror. There are several attractions that are unique to the Disney Paris location which was fun to experience. We thought the castle was more beautiful at this park as well as It's a Small World. The park is very lush with lots of greenery and beautiful flowers. Of course we expected the parks to be busy, it was summer and a weekend. It is much less busy in the mornings but by the afternoon, the waits on the rides could be over 70 minutes. Food of course was expensive, but it's Disney. We did bring some of our own snacks and water the second day at the park to save a few euros. The Disney Village had some nice stores and restaurants as well. There are not a lot of healthy food options at the food stands or restaurants in the park. There are some salads, but they are small. Also we love the Disney popcorn, but it was hard to find from a vendor in the park. You could buy it in pre filled buckets in the shops, not as good as the fresh popped though. We stayed at an off site hotel that had a bus shuttle to the park which was convenient. There is also a train station outside the park to take you to from Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

The decorations in the park really brings the holiday spirit to life.If you are planning to go for the FIRST time, then the Christmas New Years holiday season may NOT be the best time to go because the added season decor and holiday shows brings more people to the park and the lines for the rides become longer than normal. On New Years Eve, the park becomes a huge mass of celebrating humanity.... in spite of the masses, it is a wonderful and safe place to ring in the New Year and enjoy the fireworks, water shows and light shows....

It was a fun experience but I have to say that if you want to see Disney, save your money and go to Disneyworld in Florida!!!We didn't see many characters thru out the park, except Pluto at Toon Town. How do you go to Disney and not see Mickey??? They have multiple parades thru out the day and each darn time the parade came the streets were roped off. Its A Small World was closed each time that parade came and when it reopened the line for that ride was ridiculously long!! Make your lines go a different way, but dont shut a ride down for a parade!!Came out of one ride and walked right into the roping off for another parade. We were ushered across the walk way and as we got to the other side, we stopped to turn around and watch parade. We were in an open walk area and not in the way of anyone. No people were around. Was approached by a Cast member who told us that we were not allowed to stand there and watch the parade. I literally thought I was being punked! What? I cant stand in an open area, not roped off and watch a parade?? I told him I paid just as money as anyone else to watch the parade and that I wasn't in the way and I refused to move. When I said that he said that the parades are first come, first serve and that if you aren't in a roped off area , then you couldn't stand and watch the parade. Seriously? I said that is ridiculous and I am not moving. So, he called security on us! I was so disgusted with him. I told him  Well, Merry Xmas to you too  and I started to walk away. He turned around and told me that he didnt celebrate Xmas....Let's just say  some of your staff are unprofessional and RUDE! If you are going to have 54 parades a day, you would think that this company could figure out a better way to incorporate people or at least lower the amount of parades then. Ww couldnt figure out how to get to some rides because of the parade routes being roped off. Had to backtrack thru half park for a small section of rides. When we were leaving, we couldnt figure out how to get out of park because everything was roped off and the KICKER was that everyone was blocking access to the sidewalks, and we couldnt get thru to leave the park. Now please tell me why that is ok???  and not ok for me when I was not blocking anyone??? Fix your parade routes and it would be better!",Disneyland_California

Disney Hotels are within walking distance and they have a shuttle for those who need it. Disneyland Park has six rides with Fast Pass and Walt Disney Studios has three. They have Disney Photo Pass here but it works a little differently in that they don   t have photo pass stations set up to take those iconic shots. You can ask a cast member or fellow guest to take those photos with your own camera. The photo pass is used on certain thrill rides and at character meet & greets. Unless you have children who want to meet every character we felt it wasn   t worth the cost. One great thing about Disneyland Paris is that there is a train station right between Disney Village and the other parks. These trains are local but there is also a Eurostar Disney Express train that goes between the Park and London on certain days of the week. We were staying in a Disney hotel and had our bags sent to the train station in the morning.

Which is the 2nd of all    employees are VERY hard to find in this park. Except where they are loading or unloading a line. Here, they are very friendly. But sssssllllllooooowwww    which is the 3rd of all. I don't know if it's the culture or just laziness, but employees seemed a little lost on loading and unloading. On a good note, just about every employee spoke some English. The biggest disappointment came when Toy Story 3 Playland wasn't open yet    when it had been advertised as being open in the US.  Invited guests  only. Tell that to a 7 year old who had spent the last month dreaming of seeing it.

On visiting the Ratatouille ride my son was asked to pick up his 3d glasses, because of his OCD he picked them up from the back, in his head he thought they would be cleaner as not as many people would have touched them. Unfortunately the person giving out the glasses shouted  why did you take them from the back, you should have picked the glasses from the front of the pile.  Unfortunately the staff member carried on asking the same question, getting quite aggressive. My son was really upset, as he did not understand what he had done wrong.

They did offer a fast pass onto all the rides which was then rejected by all the park attendants once we were inside so we spent even longer messing around once in the park.

We could see the reindeer that were there with Santa Claus from where we sat. We listened to and enjoyed live music. Very entertaining. The entire place was decked out in beautiful Christmas decor. From Christmas lights to Giant wreathes hanging on light posts. The Haunted Mansion which was revamped for the occassion is one of our favorites with the Nightmare Before Christmas theme. Once you get in you almost forget about how long the lines are to get in. Later in the evening we ended up finding a great spot up front to see the Parade.

I have been a few times before, but a number of years ago, but boy has the place gone downhill. We spent four days queuing, often in queues that are badly managed with people pushing in (sorry, but quite often they are French) for rides that had 'technical' problems and regardless of how long you have been queuing, you are just told to come back later   after queuing for two hours for the Turtle ride, we were lucky that someone translated the announcement that the ride was being closed due to technical issues   hard to explain to an 5 and 8 year old after queuing for almost 2 hours for nothing! It probably didn't help that a number of rides were closed for refurbishment or maintenance, this just added pressure on the remaining rides. There wasn't adequate food outlets and we saw a number of kiosks closed even though there was massive queues. Be prepared to queue, queue and queue, including also having pictures taken with any characters, for a table at any of the restaurants off the park and pretty much queuing for large amounts of your day! You associate Disney as providing excellent levels of service, most of their staff need to be reminder of this (not all, but quite a few), I was even barged out of the way but one member of staff who was clearly not happy and in a rush. The park is in need of money being spent on it, some areas looked tired and water features etc were not working, there was also a fair amount of rubbish in some areas.

7530,186280081,5,2012-12,United States,"Having been a season ticket holder of the US Disneyland in California and having visited that one over 12 times in my life, I was preparing to be disappointed with the HK Disneyland, but I was pleasantly SURPRISED. I loved HK Disney. It was obviously not as large and grand as LA Disneyland or Disneyworld's Magic Kingdom, but it wasn't lacking in magic and fun. In fact, I liked that I could cover the entire park in a single day, whereas in the Anaheim location, I always felt rushed to get to every section by the end of the day. In comparison, I felt lines were shorter, many attractions were similar and the ticket price was noticeably cheaper. This Disneyland was quite a bit cheaper than when I visited Disney in the States and that is always a nice surprise. Overall, a great place on any visit to HK, especially if you've never been to a Disney park before.",Disneyland_HongKong

I am registered blind and do not use any rides, however you can only have a disabled ticket and price of 100 hk dollars if you are a resident otherwise it's full priceSo it makes it very expensive day for me just to get pushed round. Luckily it wasn't too busy as this Disney doesn't do the fast pass entry for those with disabled guests either like Shanghai one does. I had to queue in the line with my daughter and son in law or they had to leave me in the wheelchair before entering line, which can be is uncomfortable when you have very little vision Most staff seem friendly, Overall good but could do better for people with disabilities ",Disneyland_HongKong
13243,468940897,3,2017-3,United States,"Was disappointed this year on our trip to Disneyland this year. We celebrated their 60th anniversary in 2016 but this year was less than stellar. Some of the really good ride was  closed for refurbishment . This included the Matterhorn, Grizzly, Railroad, Mark Twain's paddle boat ride. On the plus side they brought back the Electric Parade. Haven't seen that in years. The Frozen show was worth the wait. It was definitely a hoot for everyone young and old. The food was great especially the corn dogs! We were disappointed with the Terrace Italian restaurant. When we approached for dinner they advised we should book ahead. I asked how would we know to book ahead we were tourists!

And every time I go I discover new things that I love about the park. Last time I went I found the Disney Gallery. To get there take a left right when you go into the park it is next to Great Moments with Abraham Lincoln. If you want to find out about the history of Disneyland and collect Disneyland memorabilia you have to stop here. There are original concepts of Disneyland, a video that go's through the history of Disneyland, old park tickets, trains from Walt, paintings and posters of Disneyland, miniature figurines of Disney park old and new, and much much more.

26780,129125039,4,2012-4,United States,"There are so many reviews on Disneyland that I thought I would write this review for moms of young kids. My kids had a great time. My kids are both into Star Wars, but only one of them was old enough to do Star Tours (the ride) and the Jedi Training Academy. If your kids (or you!) are into Star Wars, I'd encourage you to take the time to find out when the Jedi Training Academy is being held that day and attend. Only some kids will get picked from the crowd (they should stand up front for the best chance) and get your camera video cameras ready. It was great fun to watch. Star Tours (the ride) was a really cool ride and I would recommend it to any Star Wars fan as long as they do not get motion sickness! It was a lot of fun. I would spend some time looking at the Disney website to find out which rides your kids can go on (measure your kids before your trip!) and also check out some  frugal Disney  type websites for good family tips. We brought food into the park (in our backpack) both days and I know that the guy checking our bag saw the food at least one of the days. I've heard that some employees ask you to get a locker for your food by the picnic area, but they didn't make us do that. We had some water, sandwiches and pretzels and just having that little bit with us probably saved us a lot of money. The bathrooms were kind of hard to find, so I learned quickly to just ask an employee instead of wandering around. I didn't ever see a family restroom, but there are some low sinks for young kids and the baby changing area is built into a nook...so much better than those flip down stations! The bathrooms were pretty clean and employees are helpful. I found that when you are getting pictures taken with characters, if the Disney photographer is there, they are more than happy to take some shots with your camera. Don't be afraid to ask! The Disney photographers will take pictures for free and will have them online and you can choose to purchase them if you want, with prices starting at $15 per print download. It was worth it for a couple of our pictures that didn't come out with our own cameras.Strollers are available for rent, but I noticed as we entered the park that there was a sign saying you should rent your stroller prior to your visit. I assume this is done online, but we brought our own, so it wasn't an issue. The biggest piece of advice that I have is that the park is much less crowded in the middle of the week. We went on a Thursday Friday and Friday seemed much busier. We decided to go on Friday so that we could see the fireworks, but unless you want to camp out for an hour or an hour and a half before the fireworks start (not an option for antsy tired little kids OR a mom who wants to make every minute count!), you will probably not get a good view. The fireworks are really great, but the view you want (facing Sleeping Beauty's castle with the fireworks behind it), is going to be taken by the people who save their spot an hour ahead of time. If I had to do it again, I would have gone on a Tues or Wed to beat the crowds.",Disneyland_California

35527,303742950,4,2015-8,United Kingdom,"Took our three year old granddaughter for a treat and had a lovely time. The attractions she could go on we're limited so the trip was not as frenetic as past trips with our sons. The food at each of the events we attended was very good and while the service was not quite of the American standard it was good and probably better than the UK. The only slightly negative comment we would make was that we attempted to see the fireworks and closing show on three separate nights but she was not able to stay awake despite later starts and early evening naps. That said, it was probably our disappointment rather than hers but and earlier show would have been nice. Recommended for a bit of escapist fun. ",Disneyland_Paris
42045,106089123,1,2011-3,United Kingdom,"We visited in March 2011 and it was our fifth time. There won't be anymore. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was closed due to refurbishment. This was a massive dissapointment as it is arguably the best attraction they have. The was a hoarding outside the front reading 'closed for refurbishment and you future entertainment'. Do these people think we can just pop back over when they've finished? Another popular ride, Big Thunder Mountain, was also out of action for two days due to technical difficulties. This was the nail in the coffin for me. As a result of these closures, there was around four or five hundred extra people in circulation . This made the place a lot busier and queueing a nightmare for everything except 'It's a small World' because nobody wants to go in there anyway! The French were the usual arrogant and impolite people we have expected them to be. The prices in and around the parks have become astronomical. Just under Seven Euro's for a pint of warm beer. The food was also horrendously expensive and largely awful. For what it cost us as a family of Four, we could have gone to Spain for a week and probably had a much better, and less stressful time.

1089,578196419,5,2018-4,Australia,"Ive visited Hong Kong Disneyland many times. This time was no less fun!2 adults and 2 kids....9 and 13yo. We all enjoyed the attractions over 2 days. The 9yo probably had the most fun though!Weekend days are much busier than weekday.The only disappointments were probably the food selection and the Theatre. The food seemed a little limited and the quality was OK, but not as good as it could be. The theatre was disappointing as its mostly in Chinese. I get that probably most guests are Chinese, but it just left me feeling rather disappointed (there are English words projected on a highly visible screen however)The highlights for me are (Hyper)space Mountain and Grizzly Gulch Mine Cars, along with Mickey's Philharmagic. Its a Small World is a nice calm cool break from the outside world.The Jungle River Cruise has to get a mention, as the cast members always add a bit of fun and cheekiness to it. And Mystic Manor is goods fun too!If you love non stop ride action, getting fast passes is well worth it on the busier daysI havent been to any other Disney parks, but from what I know this is one of the smaller parks. You can do it in 1 day but 2 would also be fun. Its probably more suited to the younger kids (5 12) but with an open mind, anyone can enjoy!Transport options are plenty, with the MTR popular and easy.

It's not perfect, but it's pretty dang close. Add in a location with mild, sunny, warm weather and what more could you ask for?

When we arrived at our accommodation (Davy Crockett's Ranch) we had to drive through a building site...When we got into Disney a few of the rides were closed which was annoying but on the whole it just seemed like any other theme park appart from all the Disney fairy type stuff, which just didn't interest my lad at all! Most of the Disney staff were really nice however we found that other staff (such as restaurant staff etc) we rather rude and ignorant.On the plus side, they had a Star Wars Jedi Training Academy which was absolutely brilliant, My son is a big Star Wars fan and for him to become a Jedi Padawan was absolutely priceless.On the whole I wouldn't discourage anyone from going as I'm sure every family will have there own experience, but we wont be rushing back any time soon.One last point, take some good walking shoes... You will walk miles!",Disneyland_Paris
10245,624684421,3,2018-10,United States,"When it comes to Disneyland, there are three types of people. The people who love Disney, no matter what their age. The people who are doing the obligatory  taking the kids trip,  and the people who are never going. That being said, anyone who is reading reviews isn't doing so to decided whether or not to go, they're reading it for the tips. I fall into the second to third category of people but am happy to share my recent experience to make someone else's better. We went for 2 days with the husbands kids and grandkids here are a couple of pointers and things I found.First, download the Disneyland App and also pay the extra (I think it was $40 for the hubs and I for 2 days) for the Max Pass. This allows you to do multiple things. First, you can book Fast Passes from your phone rather than having to walk to the ride and then come back at a certain time. Also, it allows you to have multiple Fast Passes at a time and let's you know when you are eligible to book your next one. Other cool features are that it let's you connect and keep all of your pictures in one place, let's you book food or restaurant reservations, gives you wait times for all of the rides for both Disney and California Adventure and tells you where characters are appearing and at what times. You can also keep you tickets on your phone so you don't have to worry about paper tickets. Honestly, the app was the biggest 'Hidden Gem' of the park. We were there on a Sunday and Monday and it was packed. It didn't help that it was Gay Pride, Canadian Thanksgiving and Columbus day all at the same time. As a result, the park was at max capacity both days. What I found helpful was starting about a week before, check the app and note the popular rides. When you first get into the park, go straight to one of them and then start Fastpassing a second a third. Due to the amount of people in the park, this was the only way we got to do the rides we wanted. Also, I would say 8 12 is your best opportunity to wait in the shortest lines. By noon both days, Fastpasses were 'sold out' and lines were 1 2 hours long. Even trying to get pictures with characters was 1 2 1 hour long wait times.Don't take kids younger than 6! We were there with a 3 and 5 year old and it seemed overwhelming for them and like they didn't quite get it. They weren't super into the rides (if at all) So it was a lot of eating a shopping and doing smaller things. It's a lot of money to pay for the kids not to get the full experience. Not saying all kids will be like this but in general, it seemed that way for the younger ones. Pack the least amount of stuff with you as possible. Hubs and I didn't even take bags in. Just phones, and sunglasses. He wore cargo pants to carry Id's a CC's and I wore cheap sunglasses so I wouldn't have to worry about them getting damaged or lost. This helped for getting through security and also with rides and the amount of people. Less is more. If you have kids and need to take bags etc, just take the minimum of what you need. The one item I recommend, especially if you are using the app is an extra battery charger and cord. I have a $30 Anker charger I got from Amazon that gives your phone about 5 charges and is pretty small to pack. You will be taking pics and using your phone with the app so you'll want to keep it charged. Disney has a few Kiosks where you can rent a charger but it was about $30 of a charge. Do yourself a favor and bring your own. Plan on dropping some coin, especially if you have kids. Disney ears alone were $30 a piece and I don't think we had a meal that was less than $30 for 2 people and we are just talking sandwiches and chips. The balloons were $15 plus each and with a couple of kids it adds up fast. Last year, the hubs and I did a three week Europe trip and spent $2500 total and we could have easily spent more than that for a few days in Disney. Go in knowing everything is expensive and make a budget of what you are and are not willing to pay for. Finally, stay off the property. We stayed about a 10 minute walk away but some other family members opted to stay at the Disneyland Grand Hotel. While the location is great, you are basically paying $600 plus a night to shorten your walk and maybe get a few other things (that you have to pay extra for). For example, my husbands daughter paid to have the room decorated. It was cool because it looked like Mickey had been there and the kids got a few keepsakes but other than that it was a basic double hotel room with about a 5 minute shorter walk to the entrance of the park. For us, staying a 10 minute walk away, we saved several thousand dollars got away from the crowds for a bit and got breakfast with our room which saved us from spending breakfast money in the park. The last time I was in Disney was 2000 and I remember it being far more fun and magical. To me it seems like an over priced and over crowded tourist trap but also if you have kids or grand kids, a necessary evil at least once. At this point I can say it's been checked off my bucket list and I don't need to go back. Read as much as you can and get as many 'Pro Tips' as possible to make your visit easy and fun.",Disneyland_California
10343,618223039,3,2017-11,United States,"Over the years, Disneyland has gotten really expensive for what you get out of your money. I've been multiple times in different months and on different days, but it is always crowded. If you're coming from out of town, you'll need at least two days just for Disneyland or for Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. Definitely try to get fast passes because otherwise you're in line forever... The food is also very expensive for what it is....",Disneyland_California
28982,3004783,5,missing,Canada,"I agree with Canberra, Australia and the the last reviewer. It's all in understanding the crowd patterns and adjusting your expectations or your plans accordingly. DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE GOING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF MONEY OR CANNOT HANDLE LARGE CROWDS.We carefully picked the timeframe   Dec 12 to 17 and were blessed with good weather, small crowds (we did some rides again, and again, and again until we were tired of them with no more than 5 minute wait times). The park opened at 10am and closed at 6:00 8:00 but we had plenty of time to do everything and have the kids in bed by 10:00. I was actually glad the timings didn't extend till midnight!! The Christmas decorations were amazing.The shows were fabulous, and our 6 year old's eyes lit up each time we entered the parks. We liked the California Adventure park A LOT and spent about half our time there. Interestingly, very few people mention it.We had 5 day park hopper passes (bought using our airmiles) and stayed at the HoJo   a short 7 minute walk away. The HoJo was amazing   2Q, big room, extra sink, very clean, great staff, good looking pool area and hot tub (which we didn't use) for USD 66 a night. Tip   Sun to Thurs night rates are lowest. We carried lots of snacks, drinks, water etc. which really helped. You can get cups of ice from any vendor if necessary.A few final tips comments:  Lots of walking.   Start early, end late. Have a strategy to pace yourselves.  Eat two meals outside (or keep them small) and enjoy one meal in the park. Yes, it's expensive, but it is something to look forward to when everyone needs a break.  Use FASTPASS. It blew me away that people would line up for 30 minutes while my kids and I walked past them to do rides a couple of times over using FastPasses.  Take 5 days to enjoy the parks if you can. I can't imagine what people do in 1 2 days, especially in the summer. At that pace it becomes a chore rather than something to enjoy and absorb.  Kids should be at least 6 7 to fully appreciate the ambience and keep pace with the rest of the family. We saw mothers with babies and frustrated parents with tired tots. The kids would probably have been happier in a local playground!All in all, a great experience. The Disney magic lives on!",Disneyland_California

5801,284602083,4,2015-5,New Zealand,"Disneyland it was as a promise to our daughter! So, by taxi to Central and then the MRT all the way to Disney. This was altogether a 45 min trip and the most cost effective way of getting to the magic land.Tickets to Disneyland can be purchased online and redeemed at the entrance gates, either at the information booth or the auto ticket dispensers. The only thing to watch out for is that the instructions on the ticket dispenser are in Mandarin. Unlike the other fun parks, there was no option for express entry unless you join the Disney club, which for the price and as a visitor, was not worth it. So, getting to Disney early as advised by my cousin who lives locally was the secret. We arrived at just after 10.30 am when the park opened on a weekday. There was a small crowd but not a long queue for the rides. The longest we waited was 15 minutes. The park is known as the smallest Disneyland in the world and you can finish the circuit with a good number of rides in about 3 4 hours. The rides we enjoyed most were at Mystic World   trip to Mystic Manor, and the famous Small World global boat trip. The safari river ride was also entertaining.Each of the  worlds  is populated with a cafe or a restaurant where meals are reasonably priced. For a more upmarket environment, Main Street has a Chinese restaurant hosted by Maxims and a place for afternoon tea. There are fireworks and a parade every evening but we did not stay for that after a long hot day.

Watched the parade, took some rides, have some snacks and watched the fireworks display.We stayed at the Disney Hollywood hotel and day two started earlier at 10 am plus. We took almost all the rides except one which our son did not meet the height requirement. For the rides we enjoyed, we queue and took a second time. Average queue time is 30 45 mins on a weekday in June. Our only complaint would be the temperature! It's a whopping 33degrees Celsius in June and there is not many area with shelters especially if your are walking from one zone to another. Drinks and ice Popsicle is great but is not cheap!

Most would think it an impossible mission, but if you plan as we did and only go for the rides, it's do able! Despite not having VIP lines (compared to Universal Studios), if you get in early enough (we got there at 8 am) you can experience Disneyland and all it's main attractions and rides in about 4 hours! Despite what at times felt like crushing lines, we managed to enjoy it all! From Space mountain (1 hour wait), the Haunted House (which was also about a 1 hour wait as the ride ceased whilst we were waiting in line), Indiana Jones (my favourite) and the Matterhorn (to mention but only a few) we squeezed them all in! I stress we did not go to any shows though, purely rides and lots of photograph taking. The motto is  happiest place on earth  and I would have to agree the start (when you're entering the gates) and the end (when you're exiting the gates) my wife and I definitely had that feel, but for different reasons. It's a childhood dream (as for many) to have experienced it and then have finally experienced it after the crushing crowds (big relief).

We felt as though we had been ripped off by Disney. As if ripping the public off with the cost of the tickets isn't enough, they then charge you 4 times the cost for everything from ice cream , drinks, food and toys. A big thing worth mentioning to Disney, is why don't you move on the lucky lucky guys outside? They are an absolute nightmare and shouldn't be allowed to hassle the visitors.

29465,638499306,5,2018-8,United Kingdom,"I love Disney and everything about it but I also know they are a business. My main advise would be to do research and to be realistic about what you can do and the cost.The park it   s self is beautiful. It   s clean (I have never seen rubbish on the floor or over flowing bins, unlike UK parks). The theming is amazing (even down to the bins!)The cast members are all very friendly and speak multiple languages.If you want to know in advance what queue times can be look it up. There are websites with average times from past years. Also there is the Disneyland Paris app, where you can see real time queue times. Take a look one weekend and see what they are. If you are put off by the times don   t go!Also on the app you can look in advance to see what rides will be closed on certain days. This is also on the main website. If you have a favourite ride book accordingly.There are fast passes which you cannot book in advance, which I love. So much fairer than the Florida system. They are not on every ride.If you are staying in a Disney hotel, use the magic hours. Not all the rides are open but you can get quite a few done in that time.Meeting the characters. No they don   t just wander around the park. I have seen a princess walking through the park to her    spot    and she gets mobbed by 5 year olds. You have to queue and yes it can be a long queue. But you have to think what is important to me on this trip. Every 20 mins or so the characters go for a rest but are only gone about 10 mins.If you really want to meet Mickey but don   t want to queue there is the character breakfast. It   s not cheap but you get to see around 5 characters and an all you can eat buffet.Food prices. Yes it is very expensive. If you have booked a package you should try and get the food vouchers. It will restrict where and what you can eat, depending of the level of voucher you have. But it is a big help with budgeting. Also on the Disney website they have copies of the menus for all the eateries. Take a look and see if it works for you.And don   t forget this is a theme park. They have never been know for the best or most nutritious food.Parades and fireworks. This is when it can get very crowded and some people can get grumpy. People start staking out a spot to watch quiet early on. If it is important to you then you should as well. But for everyone it should be a standard rule that any children around should be allowed to move to the front. If you are and adult, just let them through for the parade. You will still see.And be aware that the cast members will stop you crossing pathways once the parade gets close. Lastly don   t put too much pressure on yourself to do everything. If you do then you will come away disappointed. Take your time enjoy, the atmosphere and the surroundings. I have been when it is heaving and when it is really quiet and have loved both. But above all research!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
6243,258513393,4,2015-3,India,"Hong Kong Disneyland has a good selection of live shows and equally interesting rides highly recommended for kids and adults alike. Shows like the Flights of Fantasy Parade at 3PM and Fireworks at 8PM & Festival of Lion King are not to be missed. But please be prudent and check the day calendar provided on the Disneyland Website before visiting because often some shows remain closed cancelled. For eg, Paint the Night Parade was cancelled on the day of our visit and so were a couple of other rides.Disneyland provides a good & lively ambiance and the rides are modeled on the different themes. Almost all rides can be enjoyed with your little ones as young as 4 years of age. But if you are looking for no nonsence thrilling rides , then head straight for Ocean Park. Also, the food at the park is very expensive. So it is wise to carry home stuff and have a nice meal sitting at any one of the numerous scenic place at the park. Caramel popcorn is a must try. Vegetarian set meal is only available at The Tahitian Place restaurant in the park   highly recommended for dinner after a long & tiring day at the park. Approx cost HKD110 for a set meal   enough for 2 person.The park is well connected with MTR. The MTR running between the Sunny Bay station and Disney land station is also modeled on the Disney themed. Overall, park size is not very big.

I loved the entrance down Main Street, leading up to the castle. The major let down about the park was the length of queues for EVERYTHING! Yes we did go at a weekend but it was out of season. The food places inside the park were very unorganised and they were very slow to serve people with very long queues to get anything from a hotdog in their MacDonald's style eatery to an Ice cream in the Ice Cream parlour by 'It's a small world .We did see less characters than I imagined we'd see around the park and in the 'designated' areas for characters there were huge queues so we gave them a miss as we were having a character dining meal at Inventions that night.The staff around the park were all pretty friendly and helpful. Two of us did loose our tickets whilst in the park (fell out of my pocket) which would have meant that we wouldn't be able to leave and re enter the park but after about 10 minutes spent at guest services they managed to give us new tickets   although it was harder than I expected especially as we'd booked these tickets online direct from Disney.The main parade was good but not as good as I had expected and as you can imagine the whole park turned out to see it so it was a squeeze.The firework and laser show on the night time on the castle was brilliant a do not miss must see.Overall we had a great day here but I feel a little more organisation would make it brilliant as queueing for everything starts to grate on you.

I found the crowds a little bigger overall (to be expected) but the thrill was the same. TIPS: 1) Go earlier than opening time to get in line (this line is worth it) so that you can be in the park before the crowds. Do the most popular rides first (my favourites were Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain). 2) Stay on site. We decided to stay at a campground because we were towing a trailer and drive to Disney and park on site. This wasn't a great idea because they hold cars at the gate to the parking garage until a certain time. Other people taking buses or walking from an on site hotel got into the parks earlier.3) Pre book dining reservations if it's a busy time of year and pre book your fast passes as early as you can! You don't want to miss out on those incredible rides and dining experiences! 4) Bring water and sunscreen but spend a little on snacks. It's part of the experience!5) Get your fast passes for evening events early in the day when you get to the park. Watch out for these dispensers as they can be easy to miss!6) Don't try and do two parks in one day. It's just too much to do and you'll be exhausted and disappointed if you leave after only one day.

I have never experienced so many rude and obnoxious staff throughout the park as we did this time.

Disney has just turned into a massive cash cow who can't handle the large crowds but keep jamming people into the park until it becomes uncomfortable. We were fully aware of the large crowds of the Christmas period but disneyland promoted activities for you to enjoy and when we arrived at these events people were being moved along by staff, saying that you cannot stand there.Disney have made WiFi available in the park aswell and this just leads to people not watching where they are going because all people are doing is looking at phones instead of watching where they are walking.Do yourself a favor and go to Knotts Berry Farm, its a lot cheaper and not as crowded.",Disneyland_California

The rides are very good and at least they upgrade these over the years so they still maintain our interest.

37164,243811355,4,2014-12,Ireland,"Loved Disneyland Park... doesn't everyone!!! In my opinion the ques for the princesses are just RIDICULOUS!!!! When you have a programme it tells you for eg. Rapunzel 2pm and the area she will be. The same for Brave. I think this is a really bad idea, there is people literally queing 2 hours before hand so they are in line. It was crazy, same with Brave. To meet Anna and Elsa, I was recommended to go to the Disneyland Park at 8 (it opens at 8 for people staying in any of the Disneyland Hotels) que until 10.30 at the Princess Pavillion to only get a RESERVATION to meet Anna and Elsa and the go back to meet them. I think it is just terrible that young children and adults should que for 2 1 2 hours just to get a reservation. Especially in December when it was cold enough as it is. Princess Tiana, Snow White etc. were not in the programme, they kind of popped up here and there and we only qued for 10 minutes to see these. I know the other princesses are more popular at this stage but the poor kids are FREEZINF queing up. So disappointed with that :( ",Disneyland_Paris

I would tell you something else but there are Disney people all over the web with more info. Get an app and ask people for tips here at tripadvisor. Always a trick or two to enjoy the parks the most. ,Disneyland_California

But, they cut off the line because it was full capacity, and that meant since we only got a one day pass, even though we paid for the tickets, we won't be able to enter. Lucky my quick thinking rushed us to another line where they were still accepting, so that wasn't $300 wasted. Or so I thought.As we queued up for our first ride, it took a huge slice (three hours of our entire day) just to go on a little five minute ride. Disneyland had almost no regard for us standing in the baking sun at all. My son was already tired, but to not waste $300, we got on another ride, which was another long and arduous queue. Right now, we had spent $300 and 7 hours of our family's limited time in America for 10 minutes of entertainment (the rides were good though).We were all exhausted and bored, so after that we hustled home. $300 wasted and our energy and day for only two rides. In my photos, it was almost hilarious seeing our son's  excited face  after a ride at Disneyland (sarcastic). Not happy. They certainly should do something about the queues.",Disneyland_California

Other than the fake castle, everything else is impeccably done, the rides are great and the park is the perfect size for a full day. there is a good mix of rides for small children, older children and adults teens. The biggest disappointment is that there aren't fast passes for many rides so plan ahead of you are going on the weekend or a public holiday and go to the rides you want first. It's a Small World is the best ride and it is even better than the US. Space mountain was also great although shorter than the US. Make sure you take advantage of the shows as they are better than the US parks and the parade, although short, was a hit with the kids (ages 2 & 4).",Disneyland_HongKong

Our favourite was Star Tours, which has been revamped and features footage from the Last Jedi. We were here for four days and went on it loads   we got a different mission every time. My son loved it. Ratatouille was brilliant and I always love Pirates of the Caribbean. Even the good old It's a Small World has had a tidy up an looked great! While exiting attractions have been upgraded, I'm looking forward to Disney introducung some more new rides now. Downside? Predictably the queues and the cosrt. After four days we were frazzled. And the food is plain awful! Fish and chips in Toad Hall were poor, three bog standard hotdogs, fries, drinks and portion on Aldi chicken nuggets cost 55 euros.

This is far too long for young children.The food places are very expensive. The food in Mickey mouse cafe is good for children but their food was disgusting. I sent mine back twice.

33734,387312605,2,2016-6,Australia,"This was my fourth and last visit to Disneyland Paris. Last time I noted maintenance issues, mainly broken toilets. The good news is that toilets have not only been fixed but upgraded. But, the rest was a big, big disappointment. They still charge    90 at the gate to visit the two parks although great chunks of the park are closed for renovation. If you aim to go there to see Frontierland forget it, it's completely fenced off as are other attractions. I like to get my perspective of the park by travelling on the railway that goes through the different lands. Well, that was a waste of time. Two stations are closed and for a lot of the trip you are looking at a fence to hide the works that are being undertaken.And what about the parade? I used to enjoy the parade in the middle of the day. Now the parade is at 5.30, along with many others I was on my way home by then. For kids the parade is generally the highlight but I saw many parents on the train back to Paris, their kids were too tired to last until 5.30.On the upside, the Walt Disney Park next door was all open.",Disneyland_Paris

We found Disneyland to be such a special place and truly lived up to what we had been told. We purchased a 2 day pass before we arrived and thought a day in Disney and a day in California Adventure would be enough, it wasn't. We just had to buy another day pass to get more of the Disney fun. If you have kids ( we have a 8 and 10 year olds) spend as much time as you can at the parks. For our kids Disney was leaps and bounds better then Universal Studios. Also, don't listen to the rubbish about the food and drink being expensive, it's not any worse then any other activity. We paid a lot more in London then we did at Disney. I'd also recommend that you stay from opening time to closing time at least once, the shows like Fantasia are just amazing. Take you time before going to workout how fast pass works, or you'll spend forever in queues.

You can traverse the park in under 10 minutes, and there aren't that many themed mini parks. The food was naturally overpriced and tasteless, but at least there weren't any queues!

The queues for the big rides were reasonable even during the middle of the day especially with an occasional use of fastpass. Late in the evening (after the parade) queues for most rides disappeared. Parade and light show were well worth watching, thought the younger children might be grumpy and tired by eleven pm but not at all and they loved it.

Lines were short, fast passes were readily available (though unnecessary), facilities (Park and Explorer's Lodge Hotel) were immaculate, and Cast Members exuded the Disney magic! Our longest wait time of the day was 20 minutes for RC Racer. We did Hyper Space Mountain, Iron Man, Mystic Manor, and Grizzly Gulch multiple times. We Fastpassed Winnie the Pooh, just for the sake of doing a Fastpass, but it really wasn't necessary as the hotel had given us 6 priority access passes. We only used 4 of the priority passes throughout the day. Lines were orderly and the Park was very clean. The food offerings at the Park were quite good too! We tried for the Mango Dole Whip at Jessie's Snack Roundup, but they didn't seem to carry it any longer. Instead we had the pineapple smoothie with ice cream and a churro on the side. Both were very good! We ate at the Starliner Diner for lunch, it's typical Disney quick service.We took a cab from HKG to Explorer's Lodge, but took the MTR back into the city after our Disney visit.

We booked the big buffet restaurants upon arrival on the first day and we found we were so full from a big buffet breakfast and buffet lunch dinner that we didn   t want much else so I was surprised how little I actually spent. The character dining is expensive but I   d definitely recommend it as it does save time queuing to meet some of the characters in the park. For that reason I   d suggest to do it early in your trip. You don   t want to queue 90 minutes to see Minnie and then see her at dinner the next night anyway! We   ve done both the Princess lunch and character breakfast and I   d recommend both. I also booked both at the same time as booking the holiday so the cost was taken care of and I knew it was sorted as they do get booked up. My little girl is obsessed with dressing up but I found the dresses in Disney we   re much more expensive than they are to buy at home. On our 2nd trip she took a few dresses with her though and she loved looking like a mini princess.If it   s a birthday, you can go to the information desk on your left when you enter the main park and they gave my daughter a birthday badge and also a fast path ticket for her favourite ride.

November is a great time to visit, the weather is cool and it does not coincide with any China or Hong Kong holidays so the park is not crowded.Our plan was to complete as many rides on the first day and then we look at taking pictures.We had skipped all photo taking opportunities with Disney Characters and headed straight for the Ironman experience. It took us 15 20 mins to get on the rides.The ride was great, and all my kids aged 11, 9 and 5 loved it.It definitely pays to stay in one of the Disney hotels as it allows you access to priority queue to enter Disneyland.After completing the rides in Tomorrowland, we moved on to Fantasyland where we had our lunch at the Royal Banquet hall. Dining within Disneyland is pricey and not worth the value but Royal Banquet hall is one of the best places to eat.After lunch we headed to Grizzly Gulch where the Big Mountain ride was what we feel the best ride of the day. it was a 30min queue but this is peanuts compared to the queues we had at Japan Disneyland.We moved on to Mystic Point where the only attraction worth mentioning is the Mystic Manor. The ride is interesting with a tinge of scary feel to it (it was enough to spook my 9 year old..in a good way) and created a bit of excitement to weary bodies late in the day.After dinner at the Bakery (as most places had long queues for dinner) we lounged around main street to snap photos of the neon lit buildings. We made our way to the center garden and waited for the Parade to start. It was more magical lights with our favourite characters. It was awesome to see Lightning McQueen and Mack and the other Disney characters such as Toy Story Characters, Belle and beast.Fireworks came after the parade and the whole main street was filled with artificial snow since its 1 month away from Christmas. The lights on the Main Street buildings were mesmerizing.We went back on Day 2 and joined the queue to have a snap with Mickey and Minnie. They were great and duly obliged with hugs and were patient but the queue took more than an hour. I have the luxury of my Mrs in the queue while I took the boys to wander the Main Street attractions such as riding on the Taxicab. They would not have stood well in the queue. If you have only one day in Disney I suggest you skip this.We explored Adventure land after lunch and went up Tarzan's tree house and went on the Jungle River Cruise.The one show you shouldn't miss is the Festival of the Lion King in Adventure land. The performance is awesome and its not easy to keep my 5 year old engrossed in something that is not animated. We went back for 2nd rounds on some of our favourite rides such as Big Mountain, Mystic Manor and the Iron Man experience.We found some food trucks that serve packaged local fare outside Disneyland that is really affordable so that is where we ate for dinner on the 2nd day.",Disneyland_HongKong

I exited the 7th street station and walked to Flower and 7th, about 1 minute walk, it was around 8:50 a.m when I arrived. I used the  next bus  app on my phone and the 460 bus was due to arrive at 9:15 am. If you need coffee or some snacks, there is a Coffee Bean, a Famima, and a 7 11 in the area. I boarded the bus at 9:15. With my metro pass, I paid an extra $1.40 to ride the freeway to the park. Do NOT lose or misplace this special ticket they hand you as you board, it will be collected after the bus exits the freeway. I had plenty of reading material, and got to the turnstiles at DL at 11 a.m. The first thing I do when I get to DL is get a corn dog from the Red Wagon just off main street. Then of course, do some rides, see some shows, a parade, eat some more, have a couple of cocktails....Great day! Going home was pretty easy too. My 'next bus' app did not work too well though...it said a bus was due in 7 minutes, but the bus didn't pull up until 20 minutes or so.

22353,200039978,5,2014-3,Australia,"On my first trip to Disneyland, over 20 years ago, I thought I would feel embarrassed about being there without children in tow. Don't worry   there are loads of adults enjoying the Park without kids. Tips   1. You'll need an entire day to really enjoy the Park. 2. Wear comfortable shoes because there is loads of walking and standing in line.3. If you're a female   try to leave your handbag in the car. Credit card, cash and a lipstick in pockets and you'll have way more fun. You can get a leave pass to return to your car.4. The length of the lines change during the day, so if the line to a ride is horribly long at some point, try back later.5. The restaurants in Disneyland take reservations. 6. The Blue Bayou restaurant (in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride) is a surprise gem.My favourite rides   Space Mountain and Star Tours   they are both don't miss attractions.The attention to detail in all areas of the Park, especially Main Street and Fantasy Land is amazing. For example, all the horses on the King Arthur Carrousel were in meticulous condition. Take time to enjoy the interiors of the shops on Main Street, they are simply beautiful. This was my 5th trip to Disneyland and it is still brilliant. Classic rides, such as, Space Mountain, remain but have just been improved over the years.

18288,292829973,5,2015-4,United States,"Just brilliant. It had been 50 years for me since I was last there and wow, has it ever grown. We ( myself , my wife and our 13 year old son) had a five day hopper pass, which let us move between Disneyland and California Adeventureland just adjacent. We didn't get to do it all, but managed to get a fair bit in. It was great to see the old favourite rides still there like Alice in Wonderland, Teacups, Monorail, Dumbo, its a Small World etc and to embrace the newer ones like Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, the haunted House and so on. Fast passes are definitely the go for the major rides, and you have to be a bit strategic about how to use them, but once you do, so easy. We generally got there about 10 am and stayed till 10 or 11pm. Our favourite area would have been the new Orleans Pirates Riverboat Frontierland section, and as well as lots to see and do here, there are some great restaurants, like the Blue Bayou, New Orleans Caf   and the Market Place. It's a good to get to these early if you want to get in, or you can book a day or so in advance. The parade down main street in the afternoon is not to be missed, nor the night time fire works and night show. An early morning start (Magic Morning) getting you into the park an hour earlier ie at 7am, is a great way to cover Tomorrowland and The Magic Kingdom, which are open then as well as getting you well ahead for fast passes in the other areas once they open at 8am. Taking the train around the park gives you a good idea of where things are and this is an idea to do first off. if you ask nicely the driver may even let you sit in the tender (jump) seat right behind the engine. Good idea to catch the various characters around main street and toon town and the staff will take your photo from your own camera as well, again if you ask nicely. Town hall is a great place to go to get some badges such as First Visit, Birthday or Anniversary. These are free. The Jungle river cruise has old style maps which you can ask for after the ride as a special momento, and the Mark Twain Riverboat will let you  steer  the boat from the wheelhouse for it's trip, if you ask nicely ahead of the trip. You even get a certificate afterwards. We didn't stay in one of the Disney hotels, but think that next time this would be a good idea. Otherwise you have to bring everything you need with you, like extra clothing for evenings (it got quite cold some nights) and have to hang onto all your purchases for the whole day. Our favourite ride was the Thunder Mountain Railroad, but our son loved Splash Mountain. (We did this 7 times!) . Whatever you choose, it's all great fun. And, don't forget to try the Dole pineapple whip icecream at the start of Adventureland. really nice! We certainly won't leave it another 50 years before we go back! ",Disneyland_California

Car stunt show was entertaining but 2 hour wait horrendous and 3000 people crammed into grandstand like sardines. Disney village very poor and expensive we ate at annette's (food cold) and earl of sandwich (revolting) shops were rubbish.

More rides were closed than what they listed on their website, and when we got there, more rides were closed than listed at the front gate.We went at 10am and were done with Disneyland by 4pm   we'd even ridden our favorite rides a couple of times.So, you can go in the off season and  maybe  have less people, but also less rides (your favorites may be closed). Or go in season and wait hours to ride the rides.We contacted Disneyland after we returned home because we had such a horrible time, and they did not care one bit. We wanted some of our money back because so many rides were closed, and Disneyland said  no . They said we could have enjoyed the rides that were actually open, so no discount.

39767,161463621,1,2012-10,United States,"We are an American family living in Europe. We drove into Paris for 9 days and one day decided to do Disneyland for the kids. We decided to go on a Tuesday in Late October thinking that there would be less crowds. WRONG! Disneyland and Disney Studios is much smaller than other Disney parks. However, the lack of order and management are the real concern, but perhaps this is just a French thing? The French patrons of the park DO NOT like to wait in lines for things so people jumping the line and cutting in front of others is rampant. The park management does nothing about this, so it makes the experience unpleasant for those of us trying to follow the rules.Fast Pass. We thought that at least we could use the fast pass system to ride some things. NOPE. The park opened at 0800 and we got through the gates at 0830. At 0830 ALL FAST PASSES WERE SOLD OUT. Isn't that impossible? Can't you only hold one fast pass at a time? I guess not. I think that you can go around to all the fast pass machines and collect as many as you want right at the beginning. All the fast pass machines were being covered up and roped off when we went looking for them at 0830 0900. Ridiculous!Don't visit this park, it's just not worth it.",Disneyland_Paris

34799,335524091,5,2015-12,United Kingdom,"4 night 5 day holiday at Disneyland Paris December 2015 We visited Disneyland December 2015 there was myself, my husband, mother in law and little boy who is nearly 3. Joseph our little one absolutely loved the holiday and so did we. There is so much for the family and especially the little ones it was fantastic. We were really please we took advantage of the 2 nights and 2 days free this is by far the cheapest option, we booked in January and added half board voucher on later, had we have booked 6 months later it would have cost an additional   500  so it pays to book early, and I believe this offer works out cheaper than free half board. Day 1 travel to London and stopped in a hotel close to the stationDay 2 travel to Disneyland on the 7am euro star. We arrived in Paris at 10am and then had a car booked to take us to Disney. Euro star was fully booked to Disney hence the transfer. Cant complain because we managed to get free Eurostar tickets through a friend so it was by far the cheapest option. We checked in a little earlier 11:30 because our little boy had been ill on the train and in the night I think due to all the travelling the lady who checked us in at reception of Hotel New York was very helpful. Bell boy took the bags to the room and when we arrived it was very clean, spacious and comfy. Due to a lack of sleep we made it to main street then headed back to the hotel for Dinner, we were all very tired so decided to just chill out and relax get an early night ready for the first day on the park. This may seem like a bit of a waste of time to some, but we had only gotten 3 hours sleep due to arriving in London at 10am being up at 5 and our little boy was ill in the night so the fact we had 4 days to do what we wanted we just fancied chilling out. Day 3 Full day on the park and my we walked our legs off, 28000 steps according to the pedometer on my hubbies phone. The train was out of action and due to the excitement we just wanted to see everything on the first day and ended up doing 80% of the rides. We took advantage of Magic hours which was only available if you stop in the Disney hotel or hold a season ticket. The walking proved too much for my mother in law her legs swelled up and she got a nasty rash too so when we returned to the hotel she rested for the evening but we went back to the park at 9pm to see dreams and my god it was worth it. Day 4 A slower start to the day, pictures with characters then we went in the Disney studios park instead. we went on the tram and then to the car show so we could sit down for a bit. We had a chill out at the hotel in the afternoon so Joseph could have a sleep and went back to the park before dinner so we could do a few more rides etc Day 5 again pictures with the characters then hit the rides that we had missed the previous days Dinner and back to the hotel due to the rain. Day 6 We were set to leave at 3pm so we decided to check out early and then put our bags in storage at the hotel so we could go to the park, We had lunch at Earl of Sandwich before going back to the hotel for a sit down coffee and collect our bags Facilities used:  Shops ( all!!!) and we took advantage of the free service to have our bags sent to the hotel, this is very handy and everyone should take full advantage of this service Bell boy:  The guys were lovely and helpful Reception:  Clean tidy and friendly staff Lady let me check in early but cant remember her nameConcierge  Restaurant booking service:  Very friendly and helpful ladies on the desk, please be advised to book your tables in advance especially if you have little ones, some people were eating at caf   Micky with 3 year olds at 10:30om ???? Hotel Bar:  Good service and they make a mean cocktailMain street car and Horse carriage:  Lovely ladies who ride these and they saved our legs slightly too. Hotel Shop:  Johnathan I think his name was, very friendly guy a credit to the park. Shuttle bus:  We used this a couple of times to save our legs it does cut down the walk slightly. Restaurants:  If you have children especially young children under 3 go to the buffets. Meals on the park in general are expensive, the half board or buffet option if fantastic, if you weigh up the cost of 3 courses its by far the cheapest option. There is a good selection of salad and fruit etc which my little boy loves so this was a great help for us. There isn't a drink included for the kids under 3 so I just took my own to save money due to loosing my job we were on a budget. Good selection of foods and my husband was very impressed with the smoked Salmon and Prawns on the Saturday night so thank you. Hotel New York for breakfast and dinner 8 10 Le grange Billy bobs 9 10 Plaza Gardens 8 10 Early of Sandwich 8 10 McDonalds 5 10 ( nightmare queue etc ! )All have high chairs but please once again book a table you can do it in advance up to 8 weeks before Money saving tips:  Half board vouchersTake a roll of sandwich bags and a cool bag, you can get yogurts, sandwiches and pastries off the breakfast buffet for lunch everyone does it it will save you a fortune too.Sqaush you can buy little squash shot bottles from the supermarket for about   2.50, they have free water fountains round the park take some empty bottles you can make us as much squash as you like for a fraction of the cost Tea and coffee. There are no tea and coffee facilities in the room, you can request a kettle and cups which we did and I took a lunch box full of UHT milk sachets tea coffee sugar etc so this was than free to us. Normally tea and coffee is about 9 euros a day I think so it all adds up. Season tickets:  If you are thinking of going more than once in a year or for a longer period of time look into the benefits of a season ticket, They are very reasonably priced and discounts on hotels shops etc may save you money in the long run. We met a lady who has been 5 times this year hotel and travel via plane was   500 a time so it could be an option for the extreme Disney fans out there.Photo Pass:  1 photo 20 Euro, as many photos as you can get for 50 Euros and 3 passes in the box........ no brainer. You may have to print them when you get home but the cost saving is massive. ok you don't get a pretty surround for your photo but they will only get squashed and crushed in your bag anyway overall we rate the holiday 8.5 out of 10thinks that would have made our stay more special : Tea and coffee for free in the room Paus Gourmand vouchers are a pain the park really need to look at extending the times and having more venue that you can get these from. Every one on the queue was getting agitated stressed etc and we would have preferred the free drink and doughnut on the morning or for lunch rather than 3 6 pm The amount of facilities and rides closed , we were looking forward to the train ride and thunder mountain but understand that you have to upgrade these rides etc now and then. Rude people, there are so many people who just barge and cut you up, its really annoying with a 2 year old in a pushchair with people walking right in front of you, some people really just don't care at all. Some staff need to learn how to smile, Caysie's is a very stressful place for the staff to work I do understand but there were quite a few staff who didn't smile at all and the service is slow i'm afraid to say. A Land train. I Know it would cost a lot but a land train would make life easier Photos on the rides:  please extend the number of rides where you can get photos for your photo pass Different variant of characters about the park. I know it costs a lot especially considering that the characters need an entourage of staff but we would have loved to have more photos with different characters Final Note:  We had an amazing holiday and feedback is meant with no harm. We will return but hope to visit Florida next time before our little boy goes to school. Thanks for a great holiday and may fantastic memories xxx",Disneyland_Paris

There's a reason it's called the Magic Kingdom, because it's as close to magic as many of us get to experience in the hum drum of daily life. Get in early, hit the mega rides first, then spend the afternoon wandering around soaking up the strangely surreal atmosphere of people being happy (and the odd kid bawling their eyes out, here and there). The biggest surprise? It's sensational value. If you don't get sucked into buying a Jedi Micky or a Indiana Donald (true!) you can get away with a reasonably priced day out.

We queued for only 10 minutes (compared to up to 50 minutes for other, inferior  attractions ) and only once inside we were able to see the cars being launched at what appeared to be an incredible speed. After take off I can say that the acceleration was like nothing else I have ever experienced. The ride was utterly terrifying, with loop the loop and worse, all at very fast speed.

8352,149222130,5,2012-12,Malaysia,"We went to Disneyland via MTR from TST and it was about 30 minutes journey with changing of stations and we arrived at the entrance at about 10.30am. We bought tickets online and it helped as we do not need to queue for tickets. Bags were checked and tickets were scanned and returned to us. You may bring in water and snacks. When inside, look for the park map and the pamphlet for show times. Plan a bit before head in further. We started with the Tomorrowland and didn't need to queue much for Buzz Lighter Astro Blasters. We took photos with Buzz Lighter the character. We move to Fantasyland and took some photos with the Disney Characters and this is location of the Winnie the Pooh ride. Skip it if you are an adult, but with small kids, it's not to be missed. We took the fast pass to avoid queuing at the original line (please validate using original ticket and keep the fast pass) as my kid needed his nap. We headed back to the castle to catch the Parade in the afternoon. Not to be missed. Make sure you go 1 2hour earlier to book a place. We headed to Toy Story land (fairly new) and went on the Slinky Dog ride.It was about 7pm when we decided to leave and managed to catch the Light up of the Main Street with Christmas procession, though we missed the fireworks (as it was at 9pm   too late for the kids). The new Grizzly Gulch is a fairly new park catering to older kids  young adults.Food wise   available at all of the parks, fairly expensive but pretty standard. I recommend to do snacks if possible to save on time, so that you will be able to cover more in Disneyland.We went on a Thursday, mid December and it was quite crowded, as towards afternoon, we had to queue for most of the rides, hence, reaching the park early helps alot. Toilets are abundant and clean. As predicted, there are lots of parking for strollers, if you forgot to bring one, you can rent one. There are refillable water stations near the toilets.Go during winter as it can be quite hot during summer.We missed the Adventureland but it's okay travelling with small kids, we know we can cover everything. Hence, if you are travelling with young children, do some homework and target those parks where you think your kids will be interested such as tomorrowland  toystory (if they are exposed to the characters before) and the fantasyland.

10489,607684384,5,2018-8,United Kingdom,"I visited Disneyland with my wife and 2 kids aged 9 and 4.We spent 2 days there, one in each park.We had a great time. Highlights for us were star tours, splash mountain, Indiana Jones and pirates of the carribean in Disneyland.In California park, we loved the grizzly water ride, cars (awesome), goofys sky school and the guardians of the galaxy.It was August and it was extremely crowded, especially california Park with many of the main rides there 60 Mins plus wait.That said, once we worked out how to use the fast passes and became aware of the single rider lines we actually managed to get through most of the main rides in the day.First piece of advice, get there early. The parks are quieter.Secondly, use the fast pass system. Every 2 hours you can get a fast pass and this is the best way to avoid the queues. By mid afternoon it seemed like the most popular ride had run out of fast passes so maybe worth heading to those early (at around midday for example the return for cars was 6pm!! and at 2pm the return for guardians of the galaxy was 7.30pm!)Use the single rider queue if you can as the queues are much shorter (not that much longer than using the fast pass)The parades were excellent and the firework display is worth the wait. We had a 4 year old with us and didn   t think he would last from 9 until 11 so we did 9 til 3 and then went back to our hotel in Anaheim and returned around 7 and that worked well for us. The shuttles to the car parks are very efficient so it   s easy.Overall we had a great time even with the crowds, it is a magical place and whilst it was 2 very intense days with the crowdsAnd the heat we loved it.",Disneyland_California

I love everything about this place it just gives me so much happiness when I get to go there and i'm 24 yrs old. It's never too old to go to disneyland.

34004,374145976,5,2016-5,United Kingdom,"I loved going here! It was like being a kid again! When you go into the park and see the castle I nearly cried I was that emotional! There's plenty of things to do and you can get around the two parks in a day easily.There's access for wheelchair users which is great for anyone with a disability.Plenty of restaurants, toilets, bins and pushchair bays.Rides for everyone with multi language maps available for free with how much a restaurant costs for example cheap   expensive and the type of food on offer which is really handy. Best thing to do is go very early as you can be waiting for 70  minutes to go on a ride! So take some comfy shoes you'll need them!Check their website to see what rides are closed for maintenance to avoid disappointment. Some characters come out for a meet and greet but not all the famous will be there so bare that in mind if your kid wants to see Aladdin and only get the Sultan!",Disneyland_Paris

28673,46979062,2,missing,United States,"Overpriced at $72 per day for an adult and $62 for a kid, the park needs a makeover. I've been about 4 times over the past 15 years and each time the bathrooms stunk. Also the food quality is poor. The only good thing to happen in the past 2 decades is the parking garage which efficiently stacks cars and makes getting in and out a breeze. Star Tours and The Jungle cruise are representative of attractions that need to be replaced with something fresh. Best time to go is at night during the Christmas season to see the lights and decorations.",Disneyland_California
38557,195298849,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"This is our third visit to Disneyland Paris. The first 2 were when my daughter was in her princess phase....but this time it had moved onto the bigger rides.We didn't watch any shows or parades as we have 'done' them...but if you haven't I would strongly recommend catching at least 1 parade and recommend the motor stunt show at the studios. We visited on Friday 21 Feb and although there were enough people there we thought the queues were ok. We mainly manage our rides around the fast pass system. We loved thunder mountain, space mission and quieter rides like pirates of the carribean and the toy story parachute drop. The biggest shock for us was the crush coaster in the studios. In previous years the queue has been too big but we managed to get okn it this time...we thought it was going to be a gentle ride but it certainly was not. It was 'awesome' though and probably my favourite ride. I'm glad we hadn't got onto it in previous years as it would have terrified my daughter at an earlier age, and some of the younger kids coming out of the ride looked like they were in shock.We absolutely love Disney and the only reason I haven't scored it excellent is because a number of rides broke down throughout the day...which started to get a bit frustrating.",Disneyland_Paris
7658,180153501,5,2013-8,United States,This was a great day the park is great for all ages. I had the best time riding the rides and seeing the attractions. The kids had a great time also. I suggest if you can go and see for an unforgettable day.,Disneyland_HongKong
34512,349874141,5,2016-2,United Kingdom,"Firstly, to everyone moaning about the building works and ride closures. Did you book your trip without reading all of the relevant information?? It clearly states on the website what rides are closed now and which are due to be closed for MAINTENANCE in the future giving you accurate dates! You'd all be first in the compensation queue if you got hurt on a ride that was poorly maintained and you'd certainly moan about a shabby looking park so suck it up, do your research and enjoy your trip!! So we visited during the UK Feb half term with our three children (10, 5 & and 15 months). All five of us were thoroughly impressed. Especially with the amount the little one was able to go on. We found the queues to be alright! Longest we queued was for the princess pavilion but even that was only 35 mins. (Worth it to keep walking past and checking as this is often 90 mins )We took full advantage of our free hotel fast passes and used our magic hours to queue for autographs and buzz. The staff are super helpful. We queued for 20 mins one day to meet Captain Hook for him to switch with Peter Pan as we got to the front. So next time we walked through I just asked one of the ushers where he was going to be next and she told us where to stand. One Hook autograph ticked off the list!The park itself is exceptionally clean and tidy, with people picking up the litter all over. The parade was shorter this year with no toy story float and limited dancers but was still brilliant. And the light show on the evening is amazing. A definite must see. Queue times are very quite I between these two events so take advantage between 6&8pm!I can't really comment on food within the park as we are mostly in our hotel and the Disney village but the prices seemed consistent throughout both parks. We drove so took enough drinks snacks to last us the week as it could get pricey topping up on those. And for anyone worrying about security, don't! It's top notch and I didn't once feel unsafe! We were a little nervous before going but once there I didn't think about it. There are bag X Ray's at every entrance to the complex with staff scanning people as they walk through too. Security dogs are a common sight too which is reassuring. We can't wait to come back next Christmas! Thanks DLP for a fabulous week.",Disneyland_Paris
20545,238210866,2,2014-11,United States,"I was disappointed this time around. They have made changes to many of the rides, and not for the better. For example, the Haunted Mansion was once a great experience with the look and feel of a classic haunted house. Now, it looks more like a kid's toy store with brightly colored props and very tacky colors. It no longer has the look & feel of a classic haunted house. The Indiana Jones Adventure has also changed for the worse. In their attempt to pack more visitors in a shorter time, they removed at least one important experience, namely the part where he hangs from a rope and says  Back up!  Then, there was a large round boulder that would roll toward the vehicle; this has been removed, and all he does is hang by the rope with no rolling boulder. These are just two examples of how Disneyland has changed from a great theme park to something much more tacky. I no longer look forward to visiting the park, which is very disappointing.",Disneyland_California
34830,333727326,5,2015-12,United Kingdom,"Visited here, early December with hub and 2 kids; aged 6 and 4. Christmas decorations are just fabulous. We arrived at the end of the midday parade to Anna and Elsa passing in a carriage, music blaring and artificial snow falling. I will never forget my wee girl's face when she noticed the castle at the bottom of Main Street. Blew me away. Top tips: if you're staying in a Disney Hotel use your magic hours wisely. Only really Fantasyland open from 8 10 so don't waste time doing rides in this area at other times. If you're only staying for a few days buy a VIP fast pass. You can buy them at the hotel or check eBay out. Cast members sell them here for half the price. This really made our trip. All fast pass rides took 10 mins or less as apposed to up to 90 mins. Again, if you're staying in a Disney hotel you get a voucher for a free hot drink and snack (we went for donuts). We went to Casey's Corner, on Main St, got these at 4.45 and sat on the kerb awaiting the 5.30pm parade. Prime seats. If you do have a wee girl take her favourite princess dress with you. Lots of wee girls walk about with them on. Saves you buying one here (   70) not to mention the queuing or availability. Take lots and lots of snacks for queuing for rides. Saves you money and the inconvenience of trying to find somewhere to buy. If you're short of time book cafe Mickey for dinner (I've done a separate review). Kills two birds with one stone. It gets really quiet around 9.30pm as people move to get prime viewing spots for the light show. We did a few non fast pass rides in this time and still saw the show which starts at 10pm. Take a pram or hire one. My jawbone (pedometer) said I did 20K steps. Ouft. A truly wonderful experience. One I will never forget. ",Disneyland_Paris

8662,134339638,5,2012-7,New Zealand,"This was our first visit to any Disneyland and we were pretty impressed. We spent 2 days exploring rides and shows and meeting all number of characters. We loved the Lion KIng show and the parade as well as the Mickey's Phillarmagic 4D show complete with smells and splashing water. It was hot in July though so bring face washers flannels for wetting and wiping to cool off and lots of money for cold water to drink. The food prices weren't too bad considering it was a theme park but it was not a cheap 2 days. We did find the crowds overwhelming and many people had no consideration for others. We arrived on the MTR in the afternoon and were swamped by a crowd trying to get on the train before we could get off. We had to scream and shout to get our way though. My husband told everyone they should be ashamed of themselves and then the crowd parted to let us through. We had many other experiences of queue jumping and jostling thrughout our time despite constant reminders from staff to respect others. I couldn't believe a grown man tried to push my daughter (5) out of the way to get on the teacup ride. I put him in his place pretty quickly. To avoid crowds, go to the attractions at the far ends of the park early in the morning. Besides the crowds it was an amazing experience for us and the kids (5 and 3).

Owing to the time of year that we were there (December) the queues were not so bad for most of the rides and attractions, so we spent more time riding than we did standing in line. Our ability to  fast pass  certain rides meant that we hardly queued for very long, sometimes even walked straight on to the ride.

Disneyland Paris is now owned by Disney itself, so they were still in transition on how they where moving toward how Disney is usually managed. I purchased my tickets online and it would work at the entrance so I had to spend about 45 minutes with the ticket agent for them to re issue my tickets, as their system was being merged and couldn't find our information but I had showed them my email confirmation. The only thing that we really enjoyed was the Buffalo Bill Wild show. However, the meal they served was horrible! We had baked beans, ribs, one small sauage, one chicken leg and potatoes with either beer or coke with apple pie and ice cream. We're not big eaters, so it didn't bother us, however our dinner companions were mad, as our server never served us more than once for refills.

Word of advice  for the Grand Parade, mak sure you get in position early, easpecially if you have small children, so that you can see all of the Disney characters go by. Great fun! If you stay for the fireworks at the park closing time (which I highly reccommend) position yourself on the roundabout at the end Main Street closest to the Castle.

25593,143622277,5,2012-9,United States,"I have been going to Disneyland the last week of September for many years, and it just gets better every year, especially the Halloween theming. Haunted Mansion Holiday and Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy are great, and I dare say more enjoyable than their non holiday counterparts. We try to do something new each year, the Happiest Haunts tour last time, and this time we spent more time exploring the area around the Big Thunder Ranch. There are animals for the children to interact with, but the neatest find was the barn filled with scarecrow pumpkins. We had the whole place to ourselves to pose and take pictures and then suddenly Woody appeared from nowhere. It was a nice memory of the time when character sightings were alway spontaneous instead of the scheduled line em up meet and greets. The character interaction is so much better when there is no pre formed line. Just around the corner there is a stage with holiday performers and a wonderful display of intricate pumpkin carvings outside the villians tent. Fantasyland is a joy as always since it still has the traditional dark rides that are going extinct in Florida. I did find the Matterhorn to be very painful this time around and could only sit through it once and then I was bruised and sore the rest of the trip. They need to swap out those cars for some with more padding or that can ride the rails more smoothly. Be sure to check the Disney website for Ride Refurbishments so you can plan accordingly if a ride is going to close during your stay. Also, any food location that serves fountain drinks has cups of water you can request free of charge (same size cup as a regular soda). Also, the Denny's across the street (by the non Disney hotels) sells the regular size Dasani water bottles for 99 cents if you want a bottle to carry around with you.",Disneyland_California

Suddenly a cast member is there to do a speedy cleanup, remind you of the rules, or just offer a friendly greeting or directional advice. The famous monster turkey legs are delicious, and overall we found the prices of in park food to be reasonable, which surprised us. Even though the weekends are more crowded, make sure to spend at least one weekend evening inside the main park. The evening show,  Fantasmic,  really is out of this world.

It is in need of a major upgrade which I believe it is in the middle of. Space Mountain was closed so as soon as the park opened, Big Thunder, already had a 30 min wait. A lot of the rides that had animatronics had some that were not working (It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean). Also, the number of cast members were noticeably fewer than in other Disney parks, and they did not seem as  happy  as they normally are in other parks.

27362,125190313,2,2012-2,United States,"Let me start by saying that I don't really like crowds and I'm not into thrill rides, although I'll ride them if someone else wants to go. Our family (12, 10, 8 year old kids) just returned home last night after spending four days between the two parks.What I love about Disneyland is that the park is clean and the staff are professional and very helpful. The creativity and attention to detail on ALL the attractions is quite remarkable and enjoyable. All the rides (once you finally made it on) were enjoyable, but I also enjoyed the evening parade and Moments with Abe. The Matterhorn was closed for refurbishment.The biggest thing I'll remember though is the crowds. Many workers mentioned that it was a  spring break  volume of people attending the park. I'm not an impatient person, I just don't find anythere worth standing in line 30 45 minutes to  enjoy . There were long, long lines everywhere and it just wears you out. In fact, it was quite miserable. It was very stressful that each day and each attraction had to be carefully planned, because you can't just walk up and expect to get in without a long wait. Unless you picked up your FastPass first thing in the morning, it would be 5 hours   on the return time.Oh, but what about the  Magic early morning  pass to get in an hour early? Well, evidently 30,000 others had the same idea. the only part of the park they opened were Tommorowland & the area behind Sleeping Beauty Castle. There were no Fastpasses until the park opened for everyone. It was an absolute sham. Our family spent our  magic  morning waiting in line for 35 minutes to ride Peter Pan, because it was one of the shortest lines and something we hadn't done yet.Overall, I'm so disappointed. I'm sure if we went during an off week (thought we picked a safe week), it would have been more enjoyable. However, now that I've been there, there is nothing there that I find worth going back to see even if the trip was paid for. It's just not worth the time and hassle for me personally. If you take your family, be ABSOLUTELY sure that every school is in session the week that you go. Unfortunately for us, it was a bad first experience and probably the last.",Disneyland_California

11909,535927426,3,2017-2,United States,"Disneyland used to be magical and special, but things have changed in the last 5 years. The park has lost its  Disney  touch with the onslaught of other franchises being brought in by the company, and for some this is great, but for others it feels like Walt's dream is slipping away. Things are more expensive than ever, and the food certainly isn't as good as it used to be. Crowds are brutal, even at so called  off peak  seasons to visit such as January and early February  when the park used to be virtually empty, it's almost as crowded as it is at other peak seasons. If you're a Disney fan and don't mind all of the changes and additions, go ahead and go. But, if you're like me and my family, it's not worth the crowds, cost or hassle anymore. When there's a parade or fireworks show, you can hardly move from one side of the park to the other because of the streets being blocked off and people everywhere. We gave up on the rides because waiting for 45 minutes or longer for a dark ride in Fantasyland is ridiculous. We used to have an annual pass but have decided to not renew. The food used to be fabulous, now it's just ok  we prefer to eat outside the park instead because the food is better and is easier on the budget!We'd rather use our hard earned money elsewhere.",Disneyland_California

20174,246758256,4,2014-12,United States,"I finally bit the bullet and booked a three day stay directly after Christmas, despite every review that said avoid avoid avoid if you possibly can. Obviously, if you can visit the park between Thanksgiving and Christmas you should go then to get the holiday experience when the crowds are not as heavy. But if you must go during the school break, then you can enjoy the parks, but it takes a real commitment. We stayed at the Grand Californian which is great in terms of location and even better in that you can take advantage of Magic Mornings every day. Of course, you have to get up before dawn and get in line by 6:30 for opening at 7:00, but you can at least visit several key attractions before the park fills up (by 9:00 there are already a LOT of people). It also gives you the ability to leave the park midday to regroup nap at the hotel and return later in the day for parades fireworks, etc. Apparently the park can sell out during this time, but a staff member said hotel guests are always admitted. The other thing you need to do to make your trip successful is to be flexible. (This is not so easy if you have little kids stroller in your group). We had a game plan entering the parks, but when attractions were not open broke down, we switched gears quickly to visit other rides and make the most of our time. For example, the Cars attraction broke down as soon as the park opened and we left to do Midway Mania and Californian Screamin. We never got back to the Cars ride   c'est la vie. You also have to have a game plan about Fast Passes. In general if the queue time is less than 15 20 minutes, get in the line and skip the fast pass line. Or make use of the single rider lines. When in Disneyland, try to watch the time and note when the parades shows are scheduled. Getting around the park becomes nearly impossible as the cast members rope off areas, but you can take the train around the perimeter to other lands instead of battling the crowds on foot. And you can exit enter the park via the monorail and avoid the crush of people watching the parades on main street. There are a number of holiday attractions that make the park worth visiting (Small World, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise, parade, Fireworks show, Jingle Jangle Jamboree) and the lights on main street and the castle are really beautiful. Also watch the weather forecast and come prepared for inclement weather. We were  lucky  to have a storm blow through the last day of our stay. We had a pack back with rain jackets and layers and just bundled up when lots of other folks were leaving the park. (You can get Mickey Ponchos for $8 nearly everywhere when it rains). The storm was so bad that the fireworks and Fantasmic were cancelled, but we were able to enjoy a nearly empty park from about 9:00 p.m. on. With that said, I do agree with other reviewers that you have to question the mentality of the Disney Company when the parks are so full that the staff is shouting at guests to move out of the way and they are creating queue lines with BLUE PAINTER TAPE on the ground because the lines are so long that they are no longer contained by the regular queuing ropes. Is seems counter productive and one cannot help but wonder what would happen if there were some sort of emergency. The crowds are simply too big for the park to handle safely. If you do find yourself at the park at Christmas and want to exit after the fireworks with nearly everyone else, head off to the right of main street. While we were there, they opened up a back service passage way to handle the extra crowds and you can exit the park much more quickly. I will note that multiple cast members said that visiting on New Year's Eve was not a good idea. Apparently the park is jammed as is Downtown Disney and it is  crazy.  Which is saying something given the normal level of crazy that is Disneyland.",Disneyland_California

24990,151052583,2,2013-1,New Zealand,"We travelled specifically to Anaheim mid January with our children aged 9 and 10 years to visit Disneyland. This was after a 4 month trip to many world destinations. Disneyland was the biggest let down of our entire trip. I feel Disneyland has got greedy, charging exhorbitant prices for food and merchandise. OK, we didn't have to buy anything   and we avoided it as much as we could. Actually bought Disney products at Target store and they were really cheap. But the biggest negative aspect of the visit was the endless queues and the long waits to get into the park in the morning. We went after the holiday season in LA when it was supposed to be quiet and still the wait time for all rides was at least 30 mins. Cars Land was 180 mins. The ride is amazing tho when you get on. Without the Fast Pass system we would have been hooped. Managed to do about 4 5 key rides a day using this. So if you go, be sure to master it early on. We bought a 3 day pass to get the Magic Morning early entry. That day it took 55 mins for the staff to process the queue so we could just get in the gate. Arrrrrggggghhhh, try explaining that to 2 really gutted kids. Their excuse was that they were trialling a new photo ID system to prevent fraud. Well I do not agree that I should have to pay over $1000 NZ dollars to be part of your trial and stand in a ridiculous queue. Bad brand experience Disney!!! I really feel for the price and the time standing in queues it was not good value at all. Why do they not limit the number of tickets sold each day? We did the Alcatraz tour in San Fran and this in on a limited ticket basis and you have to book weeks in advance. But it was fabulous and a great experience. Just felt Disneyland was all about the $$$ and not the experience. I hate to be negative, but I am being totally honest here about how disappointed we were. We will not be back and we are warning everyone here in NZ to think carefully about the huge expense to travel to LA and then have this kind of experience.",Disneyland_California

Pick and choose which rides that you want to go on and which shows or parades that you want to see.Plan your days... know the schedule of your shows, rides and parades. Get the fastpass for your rides early if your schedule allows, but do not be so regimented that you do not adjust your schedule if necessary.You may need to reserve a spot for your parades or shows (maybe with a blanket, shirt, backpack or shopping bag ) and sit there and wait, if possible.Ask cast members for suggestions on better seating and the best points of view, they are there to help you.... and plan on spending several days to enjoy the parks with a multi day Park Hopper.Enjoy your time in the park.

Yes, the lines are long, the people aren't that friendly, there are million different language barriers, but I always like to go to Disney parks with an open mind and our little girls know that they will be waiting in many lines and that's a part of going to Disneyland. I enjoyed this park even better than Anaheim because it really is landscaped beautifully. I felt like the food was pretty good too. We rode a lot of rides and just went with the flow. We are a U.S. military family, and the deal for a 2  day, 2 park hopper was 63 Euro person. What an amazing deal!! We were so happy with that as well.If you are willing to endure Disneyland, I encourage you to always prepare yourself and children for LONG LINES, RUDE PEOPLE, etc. and make it magical in whatever way you can.",Disneyland_Paris

27163,126395552,5,2012-3,Canada,"Disneyland is a HUGE park! Be prepared to walk A LOT! Wear really good walking shoes. If you have children 4 y.o. or younger, a stroller is a must! The stroller will also be handy to carry water and stuff. You will be searched before you enter the park for outside purchased food and drink. Carry your water inside your OWN PERSONAL bottles and you will be allowed to bring those in the park. For accommodation, if you have the means, it's worth the price to stay at one of the Disneyland hotels that are connected to the park. You won't have as far to walk to get in the park when you go in the morning. (ALWAYS START EARLY! GET IN LINE BEFORE THE GATES OPEN.) If you or your kids get too pooped, you can go back to the hotel to rest up. The restaurants are much better inside the hotels than in the park, too!Have fun!

There are fast pass available if you are good at planning to be a set place at a set time   I however am not and just waited in the queue! The bigger rollercoasters were around 45 minute wait and the meet and greet were an hour wait roughly. However this is to be expected on a summers day. There are unlimited options for places to eat in both Disneyland and the studios park next door. Stay for the parade at 5.30 pm   it's fabulous!

Words can't describe how beautiful the castle is at night and Main Street USA looks fantastic with all the decorations. The downside is that everyone else wants to see Disneyland at Christmas! So the lines are horrible and parents with strollers don't mind running you over. But all in all we had a great time. And I am so glad that we went. Nobody does Christmas like Disney!,Disneyland_California
21800,212554921,3,2014-6,Canada,"First went to Disneyland in 1963 and to Disneyworld in 1972. Have returned many times as my children grew up, and as adults without kids, and always loved it. This time we brought our granddaughter for her first visit. She loved it, but we noticed so many things had changed for the worse. Disneyland is so congested and compact that it amplifies the heat. The lineups are so long unless you are there first thing in the morning, and where Disney was famous for making those lines feel as if they move quickly with pre shows etc, now people stand in the heat with no shade. Couldn't even buy a Dolewhip as the lines were too long! Wouldn't you open a second stand or cash register? The kids used to be able to just run up and give the characters a hug, but now the lineups to see them are as long as 2 hours because kids and parents are encouraged to take pictures and get autographs, both money  makers for a Disney, but not very child friendly. You think you could get around this by booking character meals, but even then you wait forever because it takes so long before you can get past the featured character, and then at each table for the character to sign autographs and pose for pictures. The kids are so excited they barely touch their phenomenally expensive meals   the most expensive Mac and Cheese I ever bought   and it had hot dog instead of truffles. The rides were disappointing too. There used to be a storyline and they were so creative and used science so effectively   go to the Muppets movie and StarTours as examples. Now they are predictable   an interesting car to ride in, but then just songs and scenes from the movie. I would have thought they could do so much more. Pirates of the Caribbean has been remade to match the movie. It is so dark and all the fun is gone. Very disappointed in Flik's Fun Fair and Toontown   the jokes seemed aimed at adults, not kids, and the Puddle Park was just a trickle of water from a shower. There are some creative things, with more at California Adventure than Disneyland   Fantasmic, World of Colour, Turtle Talk With Crush, Cars Land, and especially Aladdin   much better than the Broadway show. Stand to the right on Main Street to watch the fireworks   the trees on the left block your view if you are on that side. And why insist everyone stand, which puts the kids at such a disadvantage. Won't go back too quickly, and will never take a child old enough to know about autograph books!",Disneyland_California

First time I was celebrating my engagement and now that my parents came we went again.This time it was raining a lot but it did not prevent us from having loads of fun. Actually, the rain made it different and somewhat memorable.Plus, park wasn't too crowded which made easy to go to the busy attractions quite easy in fact. My mum, who is on her 50's, even cried after the ride in the old replica cars from the main street to the castle. My dad, late 50's, laughed as I can't remember in long time. My brother (26) loved it. We had only 2 days, one for each park and it was enough to see everything we wanted and even repeat some. The money should not be, at all, a concern. After your visit, you will definitely say it was a well spent money. That's because they keep the parks perfect. Landscape and details.

I felt like it lacked atmosphere and didn't have as many rides as I would have expected. Food outlets were limited and I wouldn't recommend the western food. The staff were friendly.

It has been made an actual thing that you can't actually smoke around the parks, which is great, and they created special places to go if you wanted to smoke. It was nice but then all of a sudden despite the rule, you would walk past and into people smoking and no regard around kids, this really annoyed me, but I'm sure it is very hard to police.

20698,235286655,4,2014-10,United States,"We booked a trip to Disneyland because my spouse had never been. Having grown up in SoCal, I went there several times as a kid, so I knew what to expect. However, at more than 50 years old now, I realized I didn't miss Disneyland all that much. Granted, it's fun! It's Disneyland! But we got our fill of everything PDQ. First of all, it was over 100 degrees in Anaheim that day; SoCal was in the grip of an October heat wave. Don't go when it's hot! Just don't! By the time we left, after 7 hours there, our brains were nearly cooked. We'd already bought hats (which were nice hats, of course) but not because we really wanted to...we HAD to. $20 per hat. Not that bad, really...I expected to pay more. And we'll keep the hats; we chose understated colors and minimal designs. But the heat was killer; I saw a couple of people laid out in the shade, at the edges of the walkways, with what looked like wet towels over their eyes. I was feeling woozy myself, especially after riding the Matterhorn. That ride jolted my old bones really good. It was just as fun as I remembered, though...only way more headache making.Our first ride of the day, Indiana Jones, got stuck halfway through. We sat there for 15 minutes, and during this time, they turned on all the lights. Talk about ruining the illusion! Like seeing the club that looks so cool and hip at night in broad daylight; tacky, grubby and sad. They offered us a second ride once we pulled back in to the landing pad and we took it. But it wasn't the same...we were definitely over it! We rode Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean and did the Haunted Mansion...that line was really long, and really hot. We heard not long after that all 3 of those rides had been shut down. Didn't hear why, though...maybe the heat was causing problems. But we felt good that we got our turn. We split a cheeseburger and fries, with a really good cupcake and got a soda, all for about $25. Not too bad, in my opinion. We worked really hard to avoid dishing out dollars for food there. We did splurge on some nice Disney sweats, to the tune of $40 a pair. But we wear sweats and they were nice, and it was a vacation, so we bought 'em. We did pretty well money wise, and actually came home with $150 of the $500 we budgeted. I was proud of us!Long story short, we made a memory and I took 300 pics. Literally. 300. They came out great. We had a good time til the last ride of the day: Star Tours. It's a Star Wars virtual space shuttle ride and by the end we were both feeling faint. I can proudly say we did Disney till we were nauseous! It was fun and memorable, especially if you've never been. But I don't see how families with more than 3 people can manage it, really. It's expensive and exhausting. Nothing to complain about though, at all. Disneyland will always be magical!",Disneyland_California

28381,115553618,4,2011-6,United Kingdom,"My goodness this place operates like a well oiled machine! However: Charming, exciting, clean and well organised as Disneyland is, it is my firm belief that you MUST DO YOUR HOMEWORK before you go, in order to get the most out of your time at  The happiest place on Earth. I would not do anything less than a 3 Day Park Hopper ticket, allowing you a day in each of the parks, a bonus day to re visit your favourite rides and the opportunity to go souvenir shopping at a more leisurely pace! Having said that I wouldn't have wanted any more than 3 days, as we were beginning to tire and had experienced sensory overload by then!Pay full attention to the basics of eat, heat, feet and sleep to survive and make sure you understand the Fast Pass system before you go. Without wishing to sound like a total  Theme Park Commando  I also suggest that you have a plan. Work out which rides you really want to do, mark them on the downloadable map beforehand and familiarise yourself with the location of these attractions so that you are not dithering around on the spot working out your next movement. Also pick up the leaflet at the entrance which tells you about the show parade times and the operating hours of the park for that day.We did 17 hours straight on the first day, making full use of our Magic Morning pass (part of the 3 day ticket) early entry and late closing. The distances are not too great in either park or between the two, so walking around wasn't a problem with 2 kids.

The moment one enters the sprawling premises, one realises that only an American venture can be so elaborate, high tech & beautiful. With nothing much to do for a family visiting Hong Kong (in terms of activities involving kids), Disneyland more than made up for it. Built like a fairy  fantasy land with separate sections, one ideally needs 2 full days to be able to enjoy everything. Crowded like mad, there are long queues even for getting snaps clicked with disney characters all over. The 3 parades in a day were a spectacle to watch esp the end of the day as it was Halloween Theme in place. However, my son was hugely disappointed as he totally missed out on doing  Adventure Land  & still regrets it. Fault wasnt ours as we spaced out everything well after finding out shut down time from staff  site who told us it was 2000h. however, when we reached Adventure Land at about 1915h with 45mins to spare, it had totally shut down & nobody could explain as to why as all other sections were still open. Also, we had lost about an hour in the morning view heavy rains. But the authorities wouldnt allow us even limited entry of an hour into the Adventure Land the next day. that i personally feel was highly unprofessional & insensitive as THEY had shut down the section way before closing time.

However the number of main rides out of action and other building works is currently pretty unacceptable. As a consequence some areas are mere ghost towns now. From the moment you arrive the beautiful gardens in front of the Disney hotel are all behind boards... No grand entrance there. Frontier land is all but dead except for the haunted manor. No coaster no paddle boat and just acres out of action space. Just pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones going in adventureland so nothing much left to do here. This leaves this entire side of the park pretty deserted and a waste of time. Small world, Disney train and Peter Pan are out all of action, taking the Heart out of that entire kingdom too.

Im only here for 4 days and I'm not coming back so yes it really pee me off .So now with the closure of Thunder mountain and Dumbo the park has lost its best rides so I may as well gone to Alton towers!You can go round the whole park in a day so to suffer 4 days going on the same rides was tedious to say the least, couple this with the rip off prices and you leave the park feeling as though you have been mugged literally.15 euros for a baseball cap, 8 euros for a slush puppie, etc. This wouldn't be so bad if you were on your own but when you have kids with you it soon starts to mount up.If you eat outside the park, apart from mcDees the prices are astronomical and to be honest you are in the middle of nowhere so you have to pay the going rate I'm afraid.I will be frank with you all out there, after you have paid for the trip and the food you may just as well go to the travel agent and go to florida for 2 weeks instead and I bet you the price difference will be negligible and you will enjoy USA much more than Paris.

First many rides are neither very long (with respect to time) nor small. They finishes exactly at the time when you reach to the extreme of excitement. The only issue is waiting time. The better thing compare to studio is that there are few rides which are open early for Disney hotel guests. On the other hand one should do homework for the rides availability (should not be under maintenance). We stood in front of one Gate to catch the ride early and after waiting for around 20 minutes they announced rides are not working and some where under maintenance. The fire show at night is very nice but a tip to photographers, go with wide angle lens and stand in front as near as possible to the castle. The Fire works doesn't go very high but is just few feets above the Castle. If you are far away, you will find many people standing in front of you and they don't listen.",Disneyland_Paris

Since the age of 10 I have visited Disneyland in Orlando, Florida countless times and unfortunately Euro Disney will NEVER live up to the American Disneyland. Having said that, I think Europe has got a pretty good version and I'm so glad it's so close to the UK.We did visit Disneyland Park in the school summer holidays so we were prepared for it being busy. We did queue for an incredibly long time to buy tickets and we experienced several 'queue jumpers' which went completely unnoticed by staff even when one person complained to the lady in the ticket booth!The weather wasn't brilliant on the day we visited, very cloudy with showers, yet we did manage to ride a selection of rides. (I'm not a fan of big thrill rides, unlike my husband, so this is why Disneyland is particularly good for me) Queue times for rides on the particular day we visited were quite long so we decided to head for Peter Pan's Flight, Blanche Neige et les Sept Nains (Snow White) and Les Voyages de Pinocchio   all of these had long queues but were worth the wait.After this we queued for a while for Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril, but again, these were worth the wait (Pirates of the Caribbean has got to be one of our absolute favourite rides   the theming and music are just fantastic!)Other rides worth riding:1. Big Thunder Mountain (The BEST version of this ride and one of my favourites!)2. Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast3. Phantom ManorOverall we had a really lovely day in Disneyland Park. The park is very clean and well maintained with the same layout as the American parks. I love how beautifully Disney Parks are designed and Cinderella's Castle is simply stunning!

36669,262218729,3,2015-3,Portugal,Imy wife and I took our daughter and three children 9 13 15 to Disney Workd before Easter.I recon that 90% of the tome is spent in queuing and 10% using the rides one had paid for.A three day pass for 3 adults and 3 children cost     840.00. Do not order a glass of wine at the Bistro restaurant. I recon their glass is 10.cls That's aroubd 9 glasses to a bottle that cost trade aroubd    5 .00 but the consumer pays     10.00 a glass This equates to     85.00 profit on every bottle sold. Greed. Comes to my mind. Our hotel exchange rate was    111.00 yo the UK pound. When even banks were giving     136.00 to the UK pound.Sadly greed takes over when mass tourism takes over.Baddbottle,Disneyland_Paris

Christmas set up was fantastic , weather very cold , colder than uk would recommend staying in the park and if you can afford it Hotel NewYork which is excellent. Sante Fe is good basic, but a 20 min walk or 10 min on shuttle bus. would advise that you book your meals in advance as you save about 15% and would recommend treating your self and eating in the hotels in disney. Generally a set price 20 Euros for a three course and 12 euros for kids depending on which hotel, the new york will be a higher set price than Santa Fe if budget is tight the Sante Fe is a fine place to stay. Also the disney shops are fantastic and much better than those in the UK when we returned we wanted to buy some things we had seen in Paris but couldnt as they dont stock it in ukwe had the most wonderful time",Disneyland_Paris

Book online from klook app to get discount. This only saves time as on spot booking as long que.3. Always reach disneyland by its special metro train as its interior is superb and gives you great feel.4. Take map or use free wifi to access their app for show timings and ride schedule.5. Do not miss any of the live shows as they are worth watching and direction is highly creative.6. Always ask from disneyland employees at ride entrance exit for stickers as they usually keep and gives it for free as soveniour, even when you leav door person can also give you some JUST REMEMBER TO ASK POLITELY.Rest this is worth visiting and whatever age group you belong you cannot miss DISNEYLAND LA LA LAND!!!",Disneyland_HongKong

Parade was good. The park was open till 11 in night and the queing time was way less than rest of day after 6 pm. We hardly waited for 10 15 mins for each ride. Fast passes get over early in the day. But we had hotel fast passes so we we could use them whenever we wanted on the day mentioned on pass. We went on weekdays and it was crowded in morning even in magic hours. So for me magic hours were not worth, rather evening time was better with lesser time in queues. Walt studio was small and crowded at opening and lesser busier around 4 pm. We had character dining experieces in aubre de cendrillion, inventions and plaza garden restauraunts,,,5 characters each time (which was ore than enough). Three days were good enough to explore both parks. There are not many thriling rides for teenagers  adults.The night light show was great and was for 25 mins approx.

Seems like you just wonder around while they hope you're forced to shop because theirs so few rides open that those lines are way too long.

17315,318782200,5,2015-10,United States,"Disneyland is one of those places that I can visit all the time and never grow tired of it. Tired of crowds, yes. But the park itself is always great. The most recent trip taken to Disneyland was during the Halloween festivities, during the Diamond Celebration. My husband and I participated in Mickey's Halloween Party. We wore our costumes (Chewbacca and Han) and trick or treated along with many others. This was one of the most unique Disneyland experiences I've had. It was really fun being able to be a kid again and dress up. The candy wasn't so great, and good luck having any food allergies. I asked one of the cast members about gluten free options (I'm allergic to wheat) and she was completely clueless. Fortunately, they were also giving away baby carrots as well as candy. Not exactly what one wants when trick or treating, but the experience was why we were there. We were able to catch some fireworks, which never disappoint. The problem I have is that it's nearly impossible to find seating as people decide to save spots for hours. I actually saw a woman lying on the floor on her beach towel asleep. Not cool. I'm sure in the future, Disney will crack down on those folks. As far as rides go, I can't say there are any Disneyland rides that I don't like. My favorites include Space Mountain (don't ride if you get motion sickness), Haunted Mansion (Nightmare Before Christmas until Christmas day), and Indiana Jones. I wish the Matterhorn was a bit smoother ride. I could enjoy it when I was younger, but now it just hurts. As long as you do fast passes (where available), you can have an enjoyable time. Some tips: do the most popular attractions when the park opens. Get fast passes for the shows (Fantasmic). Eat as many Dole Whips as possible. Buy lots of awesome stuff.",Disneyland_California

39949,156766247,1,2013-4,United Kingdom,"justt returned from disneyland paris on friday 5th april after five days in the disney hotel cheyenne,,,,first of all this was my second trip to disneyland paris with my disabled son and partner and i can tell you what a failure disneyland is to disabled people,on the first day we went to city hall to receive a disabled badge for easy access onto rides firstly the guy in city hall didnt understand us and gave us the wrong card which meant we couldnt get on many rides,i then went back the next day to get this card replaced to be told by another guy working in city hall that he couldnt give me another card as i already had one he was geting very nasty to me and actually said he didnt understand what i was saying which i found astonishing as he shouldnt be working there if he didnt understand,,,i come from belfast with a british accent not timbuktu..when i finally got this card replaced we set of to enjoy the rides but after showing this green card we where left standing whilst the ordinary queue was moving quicker than the disabled queue and this was when boats and rides passed with empty seats,also at the designated area for disabled people to watch the parade they had a rule that only one of the childs parent was allowed to enter this area with there disabled child which i found quite odd as his mum had to stand outside the disabled area which then made my son scared..also i had a argument with 3 of the staff at the train bus ride in disney village that takes you through the set of london and a mountain feature with a rush of water and fire,,,we entered the disabled area and showed are green badge for the ride and the girl at the disabled area said we would have to wait 30 mins to go on this ride and she marked us down in her folder which we didnt mind but she said we couldnt leave the area so we stood and waited then a crowd of people entered this area,this girl i was originallly talking to left and went on the tour and left somebody else in charge,we where told we where the next tour when it arrived but when it did arrive we never got on it and this was after waiting 45 mins already,i then called her and said we where meant to get on that tour and you let other people go in front of us and my child is starting to get distressed she then said sorry you are on the next one thats when i got angry and said are card number is in the folder that you have are you not reading it she then didnt no what to say and there was about 4 of them that huddled together and started talking french to each other as they obviously didnt no what they where doing which i then told them its a disgrace use dont no what is going on use need to start reading the folder and taking account for what use are doing,we then got on the ride after waiting 1 hour which was originally meant to be 30 mins as for the price of food in the park and hotels its a total disgrace mainly all burgers and chips and no decent food to be got anywhere,,for instance we got 3 burgers 3 chips and 3 cokes and it was 35 euro at todays going rate that is about 35 pounds sterling these are the prices all over disneyland and i dont think you would get any cheaper as some other areas are dearer and to be honest these are not great burgers and chips kfc is a lot better and thats honestly,,as for items for sale in the shops take your disneyshop in your high street in the uk and every item is double the price in the parks and hotels in disneyland.we also seen 2 rats in the park one was massive and the other was on its way there also..all in all french ignorant,expensive,wont be back,,staff training poor..rides breaking down whilst on them which was peter pan ride. french IGNORANT staff training is a must for disney staff...airport staff at charles de gaulle airport where also a total disgrace to my disabled son they didnt think he was disabled and he was in a wheelchair they made me lift him out for security and i already had details put on my holiday arrangements that he was which when i was explaining this at security and after showing them a disabled badge they didnt no what i meant,,passengers behind us at security actually came over to us at departure lounge and couldnt believe what happened and they even said that it was a disgrace at what they made us do,,,i believe that if you want to visit disneyland save your money for florida as eurodisney is not worth the money...ALSO keep your valuables with you at all times,we left my childs wheelchair pram outside the peter pan ride with my sons mickey mouse blanket draped over the back of the handles securely,when we got of the ride the blanket had been stolen which we couldnt believe what sick minded people are out there that they would steal a blanket of a disabled pram not to mention who would give there child another childs blanket is beyond belief,obviously who ever done this had watched us leaving the pram outside peter pan ride and entering the ride to then steal the blanket,to be honest we where glad as we could have easily left valuables attached to the pram,i asked the disney staff did they see anyone at the pram and yet again she didnt no what i was saying...TYPICAL..i hope this helps a lot of people make up there mind before they visit or think about visiting. thanks",Disneyland_Paris

Lets get down to business. The park is beautiful, its clean, the rides are fun, the service at Disney is always pleasant when you interact with the staff.. you will always have more Pros then Cons when talking about a Disney park...Lets discuss some problems you may face at the park. The lines are horrible, yes they preach the fast pass is great, but they need to come up with an idea to get the lines either moving faster or to be a lot more pleasant. First idea why can't you put benches along the route of lines to sit for a bit while you wait?. When your standing for over an hour your feet are killing you. I have a daughter, between her and the pregnant wife, you get the point. I am sure this is an eternal problem the parks face and I imagine they have a few rocket scientist trying to figure out a solution. Lets just get back to the basics.. benches every few feet!!!!! Maybe some cushion floor to help withstand the standing..Lets talk about food!! Flavor of the food overall where I ate is good. Problem is all the restaurants are full. Yes they recommend you reserve weeks in advance. On my Monday visit! The app said the park was at estimated 65% capacity... Almost Every restaurant in Frontier land was not accepting walk ins. I cannot imagine 100% capacity... Yes i get the point reservations!! But it needs to be a lot more free flowing. Parks should be fun, not schedule driven. Wake up at 7:15am, have breakfast at 8:15am, walk to park at 9:15am, fast pass booth at 10:15am for star tours ride, eat at 1:15pm.. back to fast pass distribution 2:15...you get the point... its like you need to program your cellphone calendar for all the reminders... vacation and theme parks are about feeling free and not living by the real world. Lets get a little more detailed.. tomorrow land has become Star wars land.. don't get ME wrong, I love Star wars, but what happened to Walt Disney's vision of innovation to the future? Keep the stuff you have but look to innovate and bring in things that will Amaze us!!! The park is magical in the sense of being the original creation of Mr. Disney himself. If your a history buff, its a great feeling to walk into history... I had a hard time writing this review because I had a great time with the family. I leave the park administrators with the pic I posted to this review to remember what Disney was working to accomplish!! Its not easy to write a review because experiences are so diverse and can have so many biased opinions. I feel I was fair and I hope you all have an amazing time... Disney parks are amazing and they should keep working to get the maximum experience for all guest... I did not post all the Pros and or Cons.

However on the Saturday was obviously very busy and some rides which were 5 minutes qeueing on Friday were now more like an hour. The biggest negatives for us, were some French visitors smoking constantly throughout the park even though there was designated smoking areas. This was particularly a problem when waiting for the fireworks at night and when qeueing for rides, especially when there was small children everywhere. There were signs saying smoking fines but these went unnoticed which was disappointing. Also there were not very many characters about to get autographs and photos with, and the princess pavilion qeue time was 2 hours, but they couldnt tell us which princess we would be meeting at the end of the qeue!

My suggestion is that you come in early so by mid day you will finish all the rides and you can enjoy the rest of your day back to the city.

The crowd control is also lacking, WDW has this down pat, this park does not. People jumping the cues and staff oblivious to it. There also seems to be a lack of rides. We weren't even there during high season and by noon the line ups for most rides were an hour to 2 hours long and fast passes had run out for many rides within a couple of hours of opening.

1257,565927863,3,2018-3,Singapore,Visited yesterday amidst great anticipation as our last visit was two years ago and we knew there were some new attractions as well as some old ones we wanted to revisit. Checked the website not much info. Reached there day started well at new Star Wars attraction and iron man show but soon discovered attractions like mystic point supposed to be brand new down Down due to technical error and Lion king show was also closed and toy story parachute ride was also closed. Mind you these are all star attractions! How can a park charge full admission when three star attractions are closed??!! This resulted in crazy queues by mid afternoon bec each ride show you can imagine should have been able to take a few hundred people off the track at each point!!! We left by 430 after the parade bec the crowd had gotten to the point of ridiculous. Sure people can fit into the park but with major rides closed this is not fair to paying customers flying in from overseas!!! A partial discount or meal vouchers should be offered when more than one major attraction is closed. Disappointed and unlikely to come back again.,Disneyland_HongKong

29462,638598299,5,2018-11,Spain,"We are Disney fans, we've both been to Disneyland (and World) a multitude of times. However, it was our first trip to Disneyland Paris and our first Disney trip of any kind together. It was much busier than we had expected it to be, but that didn't really translate to queueing time. The longest we waited for any ride was 20 minutes. That was for Snow White, which was the first ride we hopped on the first morning in the park. We walked into pretty much every ride. The ones that did have queues, we just grabbed Fast Passes for. We had an awesome time. The park was definitely smaller than the American ones, but I don't think it's fair to make direct comparisons. Well, I maybe will anyway. I was totally gutted with the Indiana Jones ride, as in California it's an awesome ride rather than a coaster that goes upside down. It's one of my favourite rides as well so, I was pretty gutted to walk away (jelly legged) with a headache. However, if you love upside down coasters, you'll probably love it. Hyperspace Mountain also went upside down, but because it was in the dark it wasn't as bad. It's a trip I'd make again.",Disneyland_Paris
24348,161326080,5,2013-5,United States,"Disney is magical. We went on a fairly crowded day, but took advantage of fast passes and single riders' lines so we didn't spend the whole day in lines. We got in lots of rides, but were dismayed by the number of ride  break downs , we'd never experienced this before at Disneyland, some of the major rides experienced  shut downs  at some point during the day, Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Radiator Springs Racers. We were pleased to find some healthy choices for snacks in the park, fresh fruit and hummus with pretzels. For meals it continues to puzzle us why there isn't a good fine dining option. The World of Color show was amazing in California Adventure. We got viewing area admissions ahead, but still could barely see the lower half of the show as the people were absolutely packed into the viewing areas. Overall a great experience, love seeing the Disney Characters!",Disneyland_California

That in itself would be fine, except for the fact that most staff members were rude, disinterested, and did not seem to want to help out guests of the park in the least. It seemed as though our spending our money to get into the park and purchase items was a type of 'privilege'!Also, after many great experiences in the US (especially at Disneyworld Florida, which we highly recommend!) with the Fast Pass system, it is almost non existant in Paris! Sure, they claim to use it. But most of the times we tried using it they were hard to find, we ended up in long lines anyway, or they would just shut them down altogether...even if the regular line was very long.While we would go back to Disneyworld Florida any time, we will not be returning to Disneyland Paris. Why spend money on a smaller park with higher prices...longer lines and confusing   inefficient Fast Pass systems....While the staff treats you in such a rude way? I tried ignoring the bad reviews I read on Tripadvisor before we left. However, sadly, now I know what it is like from first hand experience: Stay away! Go to Florida instead!

There is always so much to do and Disney is good about adding new experiences or decorating the park for the seasonal holidays. I've been too many times and never had the same visit twice. The rides are awesome, the food and snacks are awesome, the merchandise are awesome and the customer service is awesome. Does it cost a lot? YES but it's one place that is worth the cost when u consider the alternative theme parks. Did I mention the park is clean, very clean for the amount of people that go through every day!

Fortunately, we started each day at 8am and were able to ride 3 4 rides before the big crowds arrived, and we also made use of the new MaxPass system. It was a lifesaver! In three days, we rode every ride that the kids wanted to hit, at least once or twice, and we must have avoided 4  hours in line every day. If you are looking for a magical getaway, despite what you might think, December is probably not your best bet. It seems as though everyone in California has a SoCal or Annual Pass, so even if it not during a weekend or school break, the park is insanely and painfully packed.

24418,160001577,3,2013-4,United States,Not nearly as fun as it once was not because of the fact i have been there a number of times beginning in 1978. Its the fact fact that Disney just seems outdated to me. Maybe I was spoiled because of the spacious California Adventure with the wide streets and wide areas for lines. Disneyland makes you think you are back in the 60's in many of the areas. I was very disappointed with the crowd control before the fireworks after Fantasmic! if you don't want to stand with 6 people up against you in the middle of the street behind the ropes. You are herded like cattle by employees waving flashlights in a back and forth motion in your face if you stop you will get yelled at. For the few minutes i was able to stop before being forced to the far end of Disneyland ....the fire works looked great. I will be back but I think I will spend my time at California Adventure so Disney will still get my money !

This was our first trip. The cast members seem genuine and really want to help. The characters are friendly and take time to interact with the kids. There is usually a line to visit with them, but it is worth it.Tip: Arrive early and take advantage or short lines in the morning. We arrived early every day and returned to the hotel in the afternoon when it was busy and then went back to the park in the evening for a few more rides, parade, and fireworks.

I just hope they add more new Disney characters like in the movies Brave and Wall E. The Iron Man experience is ongoing construction at the time. I also wish opening time will be earlier like 9am perhaps, and also, more affordable food and merchandise. So I can shop more and eat more!

32037,484724741,5,2016-9,United States,"This was our first trip to Disneyland Paris and we loved it. I found this castle much cooler than WDW (where we are APs) and Disneyland. I am a huge fan of dragons, so to see the one under the castle based off the original fairy tales (it's not Maleficent) was a highlight of the visit. There were subtle differences in Small World, Pirates, and Phantom Manor that only die hard Disney fans might notice, but all of them still fitted seamlessly in the environment. The only ride we missed due to refurbishment was Thunder Mountain. The food choices were as expected and costs translated similarly in Euros what we pay at the American parks. The one major thing we noticed that was different than the American parks was the lack of ears. In the US, we all wear ears all the time. In DLP, we received strange looks from the locals at first, then they asked where we got them. The park had only the basic ear hats headband offerings and very few available at each store. Plan on spending several hours here if you want to see and do everything. I think in non peak season, it can be done in a day.",Disneyland_Paris
17982,301665970,4,2015-3,United States,"My husband and I have been coming to DL for literally decades now. We were unable to visit between 2009, Christmas, and this past spring. The parks are completely wonderful as far as attractions, entertainment, etc. This is excepting their food. If you're going to one of their  upscale  places, they really can't afford to mess with that quality. Their burger fast food places, well, let's say the quality has gone WAAAAAAY downhill. Hungry Bear, for example. In 2009, their burgers were excellent, as were the fries or the packaged fruit veggie subs. This past spring, however, the saying could have easily been  Where's the beef?  Not to mention,  these are fries!?  Disappointing to say the least. The next visit, we'll be going to BK or McD's as that's the quality we got at that joint and others. We'll get that quality and quantity for a fraction of the price.Everything else, absolutely wonderful. The Radiator Springs ride in Cal Adv is more than worth the wait! Can't wait to try out the renovated Matterhorn. Glad Fantasy Faire is now where they had little going on to start. Watch the pocketbook and go somewhere outside the park for food.",Disneyland_California
42558,5951471,5,missing,United Kingdom,"My boyfriend and I went on the 24th 28th September, if you want a quieter time I suggest to go then, maximum time we had to queue was about 15 20 mins for Peter Pan (lovely little ride!).We stayed in the Sante Fe and after reading reviews I was a little nervous but we found ourselves pleasantly suprised. Check in was very quick although we had to walk quite far to our room (they are in blocks). Room was nice, beds are to die for they are so big and comfy!Shuttle buses run all the time but can get very packed as people are leaving to and from the park at peak times.Food is expensive and vegetarians be warned they do not cater much vegetarian choice! Ate in Rainforest Cafe, there was only one dish that was vegetarian, althought the rainforest cafe was spectacular. For lunch, try pop out to the disney village, its a lot less crowded and you can eat in various cafes which have more variety than the food in the disneyland park (burgers, pizza etc). Cafe Mickey is a must (in disney village), you get all the disney characters wandering around and sitting with you (good photo opportunities without the mass of queues!)If you are thinking disneyland is just for kids you are very wrong. We are in our early 20's and LOVED every second of it! Try get to the parades about 15 minutes before they start if you don't want to be pushed etc. Also, be warned, not sure why disneyland brings out the rudeness in people but you will get shoved into and pushed past quite a few times and the french don't seem to have any manners such as a polite excuse me.All the rides are worth a go, make sure you get on the Peter Pan ride its so lovely, and Buzz lightyear is also good. Honey I shrunk the audience is also good, but those who have young children may find it scary as there were at least 6 young children had to be taken out because they were scared.A good tip is if you can, hop on the shuttle bus to take you to Sante Fe, then pop over the road to the petrol station. You can find things much cheaper. To give you an idea, a small bottle of water is 2.90 euros in the park and the village. At the garage you can get a 2ltr bottle for 1.60. It is also good to stock up on snack foods also as they are far cheaper!All in all we loved every second of and and are now going back at Christmas!",Disneyland_Paris

In comparison, the Hong Kong Disneyland is small and somewhat limited. Food option are less exciting and rides and attractions are smaller and less in quantity. Merchandise were expensive (as expected) but also limited compared to Tokyo's one. This time round, there were less people so it was at least more enjoyable.  Disney Paint the Night  was my personal favourite. Fireworks is at 9pm which is rather late but if you are on holidays you can perhaps afford to allow the children to stay up late. Don't try to prepare your day by using any information they provide online because the online information is just not up to date. A bit frustrating to have planned our day according to their information just to find that the plan was not going to be helpful. We recommend if you wish to stay for the fireworks to arrive just before noon so you have enough energy by the time the fireworks start.

It   s not a bad place to take kids if you are prepared to put up with the relentless queues. Fortunately if you stay in the Disney Hotel which is in the Park you get access to the park from 08.30   10.00 when the park opens kids stayed on some rides 2 or 3 times do best to take advantage also we had priority tickets for one ride per day to jump the queue handy for excited children. Also taking them back into the park after dinner found we could get onto certain rides easy.Obviously everything is terrible expensive eating wise filled up at breakfast and just had a small treat at lunch then fill up again at Disney hotel where all the characters come round to your table so no queuing in the park for photos with the characters. Advice if you can save up and go to Florida you will find it   s amazing and completely another level all round. ,Disneyland_Paris

It's not just a theme park ride; it's a total sensory experience! It's lights, movement, sound and even smell. In the Indiana Jones ride, it feels like the inside of a football stadium with giant boulders coming for you. Completely immersed in the event.

The Park was busiest on the Sunday getting quieter as we went through the week although the ride queues were never more than 45 minutes, most of the time 5 20 minutes was the norm. For the longer waits we used Fast Pass, probably 2 3 times per day, but as we had 5 days in the parks we easily done everything we wanted too. We stayed at the New York Hotel and the package included Half Board plus meal plan which we upgraded to Full Board, worth doing as the restaurants in the Park are expensive, I   d also recommend booking your lunchtime table in advance as the popular ones like Captain Jacks can get busy even when the Park is quiet.",Disneyland_Paris

Unfortunately what lets it down is the cast members, not all of them, mainly the staff in the fast food restaurants, it's ridiculous to have to wait, sometimes for 45 minutes, to be served by some surly individual, NOT the Disney experience! Also the meal plans sound like a good idea but you spend too much time trying to book restaurants and rushing to get breakfast, you can book ahead but who knows where they will be on any day and when they will want to eat, madness! We will definately book without a meal plan in future, too restrictive! ",Disneyland_Paris

40874,135472467,4,2012-7,Romania,"We've just returned from our holiday in Paris. For our son 11's birthday we thought it could be a nice present this holiday. Once we found us in front of Disneypark , at 12.00 a.m everything looked like was going to be a really nice day, full of happiness. All decor, all attractions were indeed nice and good fixed, like in all the stories, but terrible busy. We have learned from other reviews about all difficulties, about long waiting in the queues and very short fun at the end, but we've never experienced before. All were rights. No matter how nice looks everything, how much fun you think can have for 1 2 min, at the end of just one day you find yourself exhausted, nerves and very dissapointed bcs you could experience very small number of attraction. For us, as parents was quite frustrating to hear our son  Mom i want also there , but find it quite impossible to do it, physically no human beeing can manage to face such a park more than 5 hours per day. If i would have to plan another travel to Disneyland Paris after we learned , i would say first of all stay inside of Disneyland if you really go only for it. Avoid holidays, no matter weekends or weekdays, the queues for best atraction are 40 60 min. Try one park in a day, 2 parks is impossible. Never expect to check more than 6 8 attraction in one day. In the morning it can be just a little better in Disneypark for the waiting time, after Disney Studio close 17.00 it is getting more busy and longer to stay in queues.",Disneyland_Paris

Parking was 17 usd and in the full sun. and there was an convenient shuttle to the park which was already fun. Getting an entry ticket was slow. After waiting for some time in the full sun someone approached us with the message to go to another booth on the other side of the square. This was very unclear though. Finally we managed to get to pay 200USd for 2 tickets    Entering the park it looked very busy. Well this was an understatement. The park was old and small. Everything was very close to each other and there were just to many people inside the park. Busy is not an issue you expect that. However this was just plain madness. To the point of just dangerous full.Waiting time was minimum of 1,5 hours. You could hardly walk so many people were inside the park. We were so disappointed that we decided to leave after 1 hour . we issued an complaint and I must say they gave us back most of the fees we paid to get in. If you want to go to Disney go to Florida.

Personally I would not waste my time taking a young family here, not only is it expensive for entry, food is expensive, merchandise is expensive and wait times are ridiculous  especially for young children!

Although the Disneyland in Hong Kong is smaller than the ones I visited, there were way too many tourists and it was impossible to take all the rides. As such, I missed out on some exciting rides. The queue average waiting time is about an hour or so. You can opt for FastPass at some of the attractions such as the Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride. The Disneyland also closes at 8.30pm.

Smart Pass makes getting onto the really popular rides such a breeze.The park itself is SO well maintained. Clean, well cared for, and easy to get around. The cast members who help load riders on and off rides were so efficient, there was no fuss. Things are so well run, and they have just thought of all the little things. There are roving photographers all over the place, who will take your photo in front of particular attractions, or with characters. You can then buy those photos, or hand over your own camera or phone and the photographers will take a few extra shots on those. Also other little niceties like the baby swap and ride area at the rides, so if you have two people visiting with a baby, there is a waiting area for one person to wait with the bub while their partner rides, then you switch for the next run of the ride. Not that I was using that facility, but I just thought it was so thoughtful that they made that available! The food stalls and restaurants were also amazing. I could have eaten at all of them!

We stopped at the Hotel New York which is well placed from the park about 5 mins walk and was part of the Disney Village. On arrival at the train station at Disneyland it was hard to find the direction of the hotel as there was no visible signs up. We had to wait for the free shuttle bus provided which took a about 30 mins to arrive and was full maybe we had just missed one. At this point it was very hot it was like being in the Caribbean. I wore boots because the weather report said there would be thunderstorms there was none thankfully.Once I checked into the hotel I was given a fast pass for both parks for the duration of my stay. After this it was about 10pm when we made our way to the Disneyland Park just following the crowd and was in a good position to film the Parade and Fireworks. These you can see on youtube http:www.youtube.com watch?v eGDN5ws 3vY and http:  www.youtube.com watch?v  RpVZOZysUc&feature related . The pass allow early entrance to both parks at 8am but in reality in the main park only a few attractions open then, most open at 10am. The Disney Studio didn't seem to open before 9.30am so a pointless allowance. Water is very expensive there and in the village. The cheapest place to get this is at the small shop at the railway station.A major disappointment was the lack of non Disney character shops. There are no chemist nor supermarkets so bring everything you need. The restaurants in the village are very expensive. In short the parks are good but the facilities as mentioned could be better.

Many rides were closed for renovation etc., and this meant huge queues for the few rides that were operating. This obviously led to immense strain for certain rides: we queued for Big Thunder Mountain (one of the few operating rides) for an hour until it broke and closed for the day. It is all filler and no substance   seriously just merchandise, there's not much to do. My son counted 32 merchandise outlets on Disneyland map app, and on the day we visited the rides operating were the (1) Hyperspace Mountain, (2) Buzz Lightyear Blast (actually okay), (3) Orbitron (addressed up merry go round), (4) the Autopia car driving, (5) Dumbo the Flying Elephant and (6) Peter Pan, oh and the aforementioned Thunder Mountain (broke down). The Swiss Family Robinson tree house feature looked exciting but its just a walk (yes, a walk) up and down a concrete tree   no slides, swings etc.I'm not sure how you would fill two days here; possibly most of this time would be spent queuing for your lunch in the Pizzeria Belle Notte. There's nothing vaguely magical about it. Actually the magical part is how it has kept open all these years. If this were my theme park I would be ashamed.

If you are a local I recommend getting a pass. You can ride rides, eat food and watch the parade. Go as early as you can when the park opens to avoid some of the crowds. Use fast passes as much as you can, this is where you get a reservation to return to a ride between a certain time that is on the fast pass. You walk past most of the crowds this way. You can only get one per annual pass or entrance ticket at a time but as soon as the time frame starts you can get another one. Fastpasses are your friend. If you don't mind missing the parade this is a good time to jump on rides. The Christmas version of the small world is a must see as well as the Nightmare before Christmas version of the Haunted mansion.

I could travel everywhere in my electric wheelchair. The train round the park was not accessible. Using my green priority pass, I was able to access meet and greets easily, I could also get on rides quickly. But this was where the downfall was. I have a large electric wheelchair and struggled to get on the adapted ride vehicles so did not go on any rides. I hope Disney read this and when they build new rides and lands as planned, they will make bigger cars to house electric wheelchairs for those of us who can not transfer. There was so much to do with the shows, parades and meet and greets that I was not too disappointed. I am going back in November for Christmas so will review again then.The other frustration as a wheelchair user was the disabled toilets. There was a lot of toilets but many were inside the main toilets which meant those of us who need a place to change were unable to.

There's opening and closing shows, make sure you go really early to attend the morning one, as you will be in real rush in the closing show if you're taking the metro or the train in your ride back. First of all, I advise you to book online because the booking queues are really long, so you will save much time if you printed your tickets back home. When you get inside, get a map, it will guide you through the entire park, showing you all the games with how hard each is. Some games are suitable for young kids, so if you're a bit older, they may be boring, others are for families which are really great, not dangerous, but you get to see the amazing detail oriented designs. Also, there are difficult games that aren't suitable for children.Tip: Do not miss Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean adventures if you're a fan of the movies.Although the food is expensive, but I advise you to eat there, we ate in The Lucky Nugget Saloon. The design of the restaurant was fantastic, with live musicians performing. It was really breath taking. We paid EUR 16 which included a sandwich, fries, soft drink & sundae ice cream.Also, in the map, you will find a list of other restaurants with their estimated price range. The only bad thing about our visit was the queues we had to wait in to get into any game. There are toilets everywhere, to avoid the queues, there are toilets at the back of each women men's room, so don't get shocked when you see the toilet full of people, they probably didn't notice the row 2 toilets in the bathroom.

Also we were staying in a Disney hotel so we were able to go into the park at 8am rather than the 10am opening. (Not the studio park though) It was good being able to go in early although not all the rides are open but we got on several rides before the park opened.I last visited here 5 years ago and there was a power cut at the studios so we only got to go on one ride. It appears 5 years on they are still having issues with many of the rides closed throughout both days. In fact at the studios out of 12 attractions 7 were shut at one point with several never reopening again that day. I spoke to several guests who had queued over one hour then turned away as the ride had broken down, without as much as a sorry. I found the staff extremely rude and unpleasant.There are no characters insight unless you want to queue for over an hour.The parade at 5.30pm was very good.The evening firework show was fantastic however 11pm is very late if you have little children in tow. We watched it twice as on the first day it was raining heavy and they had a speaker problem meaning the sound was very distorted so it kind of ruined the show.We really enjoyed ourselves but we didn't visit for the whole magical experience. I would imagine if you were taking smaller children then it would be very disappointing for them.I downloaded the Disneyland Paris app which is fantastic as it gives you up to date queue times so we used that to plan where we were going next.I found early morning and later afternoon the parks were less busy.

We went at what I presume was a very busy time (July) which meant we had to queue for a very long time and didn't actually manage to get on many rides. However even when you weren't on the rides there were lots of different quirky things to see and do such as seeing all the characters and being in different zone e.g. alice in wonderland. If I went back I would recommend staying in the park for your holiday as you need a long time to see all what's on offer.",Disneyland_Paris

My family and I go to Disney World once per year and this year I took my daughter to Disneyland Paris for her 13th birthday. We loved the different rides and the different takes on the same rides as in Florida. The Pinocchio ride was exactly like the Winnie the Pooh ride in Florida just with a different theme. So it was familiar and different all at the same time. We enjoyed Big Thunder Mountain RR in Paris above Florida and that was unthinkable as this attraction is our favorite in Florida. The Ratatouille ride should NOT be missed! So cool! The Haunted Mansion was a let down compared to Florida, but we still rode it twice. Normally we avoid Its a Small World, but it was better in Paris. The ride didn't stop (it constantly does in Florida) and it just had a better feel. The park is awesome and even though we probably won't return, it was nice to check that park off my list. I will visit them all!",Disneyland_Paris

Sadly even though we entered the park right on open and went straight to the Princess Pavilion, there was already a 120 minute wait to see the one princess there, and our three year old unfortunately wouldn't have been able to stand in the freezing cold waiting that long. We had hoped to see a few characters walking around the park but only saw Donald Duck, who always had a long line of people with him waiting for photos. The long wait times were processed well by staff and we know this is synonymous with all Disney parks, but adding some more staff for the character experiences would do wonders for the vibe of the park. We found the one day plenty to see and experience what a three year old would be interested in, especially on a very cold and foggy day. ",Disneyland_Paris

Lunch or dinner food good but repetitive but you can use your vouchers to the other restaurants in the village. All the rest is pure magic especially for kids, you will feel like a child too as soon as you will pass the gates, we had an amazing time altogether.

We had pre booked meals about three weeks before , if you go to guest services when you arrive at the park they will print you off a receipt for the meals. The park is having a well needed make over so a few attractions will be closed but overall it is starting to look better especially the planting. My biggest complaint is the smoking why with so many children in the park people cant cut out smoking or just go to a designated area.

The two day pass (for those with the time to spare) is really the way to go, given it's not that much more expensive than a single entry ticket, and does not need to be used on consecutive days, just within a seven day period of time. Given the weather when we visited (one day hot & the other rain with storm warnings) it was great to have the comfort of a second visit so that we did not feel pushed to cover every attraction in one visit. It is certainly possible to view the entire park in one day if that's all you've got however. The lion king stage show is marvelous  don't miss it! Fast pass the astro blaster ride & space mountain roller coaster to save time. AND don't miss the newly opened Mystic Manour attraction   an absolute delight if special effects & whimsy.

The parade was wonderful. Sleeping beauty even remembered my 4 year old sister from a meet and great during the day and aproached her to show her new dress during the parade, It is these touches that set Disney apart from the rest. Cast members went above and beyond to make the day special,. The sun was shining and there were characters to meet everywhere. One cast member was ever so nice my 4 year old sister said that if she had an ice cream she would have given it to him. All of the refurbishments are amazing.

When I heard my travel and tourism group was going to Disneyland Paris words couldn't explain my excitement! I'd been to the Florida park and that was amazing so visiting the Paris park I thought would be great.Although the hotel was nice (we stayed in the Cheyenne hotel) at around 1 2 in the morning something ran down the hall, which I may say sounded like the exorcist or something, was pretty scary!The catering was brilliant a help yourself kind of thing, was really nice at breakfast! We had a planet Hollywood which was delicious!The only thing was the parks where quite small, most of the rides was shut when we went and there wasn't much to go on, the Rock'n'Roller coaster was closed, the only decent ride that was open was Space Mountain.I really enjoyed the parade!

35027,323628894,5,2015-10,United Kingdom,"I've visited Disneyland Paris a number of times and I do love it. This time I went with my friend who following a leg injury is registered disabled, and her 7 year old son. Because of my friend's disability she qualified for a priority pass, which covers the disabled person and up to 4 companions. To get the pass you need to have your disability badge and a letter from your doctor. On arrival at the park go straight to City Hall which is to the left of the square just past the lockers when you go in. The type of disability will dictate the type of pass you get and you will be given a guide which tells you which rides and attractions you can go on. It also means that you don't have to queue in the main queue which would have been impossible for us. Each ride has a wheelchair sign which tells you where to go to get on the rides. Many of them use the ride exits, which can be a little tricky when you're pushing a wheelchair into oncoming crowds who aren't expecting you to be there! But stick to the wall and you shouldn't have too many problems. Other rides use the fast pass queue for disabled guests. I don't think we queued longer than 15 minutes, while many of the main queues were 90 minutes long.Several of the rides have wheelchair friendly cars, but we didn't take advantage of this. As my friend is able to walk short distances on crutches, she transfered out of the wheelchair onto the rides. Some rides, such as Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast has moving cars that normally you have to get into whilst they're still moving. But they will stop the ride so that mobility impaired people can get on safely. It's never a bother and they don't make you feel like an inconvenience at all, which was my worry. The staff are brilliant and do all they can to make it as easy as possible for you.Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the general public who really could do with being a little bit more considerate. There is a designated area for wheelchair users to watch the parades, but they can only take one person in with them. It wasn't practical for my friend's son to go in with her, and we obviously couldn't leave him on his own, so we lined along the pavement with everyone else to watch the parade, But we didn't really see any of the parade because grown adults decided it was fine to squeeze in front of us and put their children on their shoulders. During the fireworks at the end one night the same thing happened. My friend's son managed to get a good spot to watch, but a woman grabbed him by the hood, pulled him out the way and stood her own son where he had been standing. The walkways around the park are great for access, but people will cut in front of the wheelchair and even push you out the way so that they can get by. I always tried to stay to the edge of the paths so that we weren't causing an obstruction, but people still tried to push down the outside of us. What annoyed me the most was actually on the shuttle buses. On our first morning we had my friend on her crutches and the wheelchair folded up. The bus was packed. Not one person offered their seat for my friend. She can't really put weight on the injured leg, so he had to balance on one leg and he crutches. One the way back we discovered that there is actually a designated space on the buses for a wheelchair, but people stand in it and don't give it up for it's intended purpose. We did manage to get the chair in the disabled space on a couple of occasions, but at no time did anyone offer their seat to my friend. So, to those of you reading who are considering going either with a disability or with a friend family member with a disability, it is completely doable and the park staff will do all they can to make it as stress free as they can for you. But do be aware of the inconsideration of the general public who seem to lose all sense of morality when they enter Disneyland!And for those of you who reading this who will not have a disabled person in your party, please be considerate of disabled guests and their carers. Pushing a wheelchair round that park is exhausting and having to stop every 20 feet because someone can't wait a couple of seconds until you've passed by makes it so much harder. And definitely do not push either the wheelchair, or the person pushing it! ",Disneyland_Paris

40997,133502228,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"This was our first holiday without parents, we had booked and paid for everything ourselves and it was really worth the money. Going at the beginning of July we knew it was going to be busy, but the Cast members were able to cope with the number of people. We watched both the main parade and the studio parade and within 10 minutes of it finishing the cast members had managed to clear the area.All the cast members were really helpful and we didn't find a single one who couldn't speak English. We were in the park for 4 days and managed to get done what we wanted, but at 18 and 20 we didn't queue for the characters or go on the smaller rides. One thing we would say is that cast members don't seem to enforce the no smoking or no queue jumping, we often found young children trying to push past us, and with some it was clear that their parents had let them go off on their own. We saw one parent ask a smoker to put a cigarette out when in the queue for Crush's Coaster, so if you don't want to inhale smoke you are better asking them to put it out rather than waiting for a cast member to do so.We found that most negative reviews are picky and often written by those who have visited the other Disney parks. We have not yet visited any of the other parks, but we assume that Disney Florida will be a lot better than Paris because there is more to offer.

Don   t arrive expecting the same thrills and spills of the massive Disney theme park outside Orlando.

But Disneyland Paris shouldn   t be skipped if you   re planning to visit the Paris area or cross it off your bucket list in a quest to visit every Disney park in the world. It   s a good way to spend two days in France. You could actually see both areas of the resort   named Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park   in one day because neither are massive.However, there   s no need to rush yourself. See one park one day and another the next day. There   s live shows, character meet and greets, etc. in each individual park. So, it   s good to take in all of the entertainment offered.Why not? You   ve paid for it. The price of a ticket to each individual park is around half the price of one at the American Disney parks. So, you   re not going to spend lots of money on admission.Check with the parks before arriving because certain areas might be closed for renovations during your visit. It was the case for me.It   s Disney. So, as expected Disneyland Paris is best suited for young children.There are some thrill rides, but nothing that sets records and causes scares.

39198,175429260,1,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We booked a three night trip to visit Eurodisney with our 4 and 5 year old children. We stayed at the Explorers hotel, which was the perfect place for our family (see the separate review).However, we were bitterly disappointed by the 2 day Eurodisney experience. We arrived on day one around 10.15 and queued to bag check for ten minutes. Little did we realise this would be the shortest queue of the day!As Explorers isn't a Disney hotel, we couldn't take advantage of the earlier opening times, nor were the rides aimed at my children's age group included in the Fastpass scheme.We started by going around the Sleeping Beauty castle at my 4 year old's request. There was no queue. We walked around and it was very pretty and gave good views from the upper floor which enabled us to get our bearings a bit more. As we exited, the ubiquitous gift shop offering princess dresses was situated outside. The price for a Rapunzel princess dress sized for a 5 year old was 70 euros! We then went on the carousel (30 min wait) and then into the Pinnochio ride which was advertised at 20 min ride, getting to the front of the queue in 40 minutes! Half way around the queue, my youngest needed the toilet, so I ducked out the queue, leaving my other half with the other child, and we went to use possibly the dirtiest toilets I have used in a very long time (remember, this was only 11.30) situated around the back of the ride. We were able to rejoin the family in the queue. My children found part of the ride quite scary and my daughter proclaimed that she really hated the ride when we got off!So, keen to get the day back on track, we decided to go into Adventureland to grab lunch. Forgive me for including the following experience, but I think it demonstrates the poor customer service very well:We visited the Cafe Agrabah and arrived just before noon as we wanted to ensure we got there early in case we needed to wait. Already there was a couple with a young child in a pushchair who had already made a reservation. The greeter started by stating that the restaurant was not yet open. We said we would wait. She then said  there are no tables until 2.30 . OK, I said, we will book and come back.  I can't take a booking until noon . I replied,  It's noon now!   Oh , she replied,  Is it?  The other couple said  Is it possible for us to go inside?   We don't open until noon  was the reply.  It's noon now , said the couple.  You need to book as we are fully booked .  We have booked  replied the couple.  For what time?  said the greeter.  Noon , replied the couple.  I will have to check  said the greeter who then disappeared, leaving her colleague, when queried where his colleague was, he just said  I don't work on this desk . Flabbergasted, we left the poor couple waiting to see if they would ever be allowed into the restaurant.We then decided, as clearly a buffet lunch was going to be too difficult, we would just get a snack.So, we called in at the Hakuna Matata fast food joint. There were massive queues and, despite it now being 12.25, it was clear they hadn't started serving lunch!So, we joined the queue to at least pay for the order. There was very limited choice   basically it was glorified chicken nuggets and chips with a salad option for the vegetarians. The children's menu didn't include fries   just the choice between 8 cherry tomatoes in a bag or plain boiled rice. We then waited 15 minutes to actually get our food and wished we hadn't bothered. We ended up paying 38 euros for two adult meals and two children's meals. The content of the adult meal was five 8cm x 4 cm pieces of breaded chicken and a few serrated slices of deep fried potato plus a diet coke, the children's meal was two 8cm x 3cm pieces of breaded chicken (unseasoned) then one child had 8 cherry tomatoes and the other had rice. They also got a yoghurt drink and apple juice. The wrong juice was supplied   we had to correct the order, and the child meal with rice wasn't supplied   so had to be corrected.The inside seating area was filthy and dark. A memorable meal for all the wrong reasons, we ate quickly and left. The competition have  No Worries  with this one. We went up the Swiss family robinson treehouse (queue kept moving so not bad) which gave good views of the park but left with the youngest declaring  This is boring, can we do something good now .We found the Pirate area and were much relieved to discover two little play parks to occupy the children. They then wanted to go on the impressive looking Pirate ship on the water   but it wasn't open to the public!We ventured into the caves and eventually queued up for 45 minutes to go on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride which the children enjoyed (although queuing in the dark was a little frightening for my youngest).Returning to Fantasyland , we joined the mammoth queue on the Dumbo ride. This little cracker took 80 minutes to get onto the 2 minute ride. However, we were kept entertained by a large number of the queuing punters having a row over two women with children elbowing their way through the queue. There was a round of applause when the ride attendant told them to leave without going on the ride. There was a pungent aroma of urine in the queue   we discovered the reason for this later!We followed this with an ice cream   which was absolutely rock hard! I have never seen such over frozen ice cream ever! We wondered if this was simply the booth we had chosen   but we visited another booth the next day and it was the same.We decided to visit the It's a Small World ride, which I had visited in Florida, so knew what to expect. The children loved it and the 20 minute ride wasn't too onerous. We ended our day in Fantasyland to go on the Autopia ride. The queue advertised 45 minutes, but ended up being 65 minutes. Just within sight of the end of the queue, both children needed the toilet, so we had to forego the ride having queued for all that time..... Now we know why the Dumbo ride was pongy   parents didn't dare step out of the queue to take their children to the toilet!The following day, we got there a little earlier   and was greeted by longer queues for the bag check. We started by racing around to the car ride we had failed to make the day before, but found the queue as long as we had left it the day before! We duly queued for an hour and got to go on the two minute ride! We did the Nautilus walkthrough attraction (no queue) and then saw the Captain EO which the grown ups enjoyed but children found a bit scary. We decided to get on the Disney train to go around to Frontierland for lunch   big mistake. We didn't get on the first train, so had to wait for the next one which was being taken from a siding. When it arrived, was covered in soot which got on everyone's clothes and was moving slowly (until a driver got out of the train and sprinkled sand on the tracks to give it traction!) We abandoned our lunch plan, and decided to go to the Disney Studio Park for lunch. We arrived and had decided we would just grab a hot dog. There were three people in front of us in the queue, yet it still took 20 minutes to be served! The kids were complaining about being hungry and when I got to the front of the queue, I was greeted with the news that there were only three hotdogs left! The time was 1.30pm.So, now understanding why other guests in our hotel were smuggling rolls out at breakfast time, we abandoned the queue and found another stand and walked away victorious with four cold hot dogs, two cokes, two juices and two packets of salt and vinegar crisps (no ketchup left!) Another 38 euros...We aimed for Toy story playland as it looked in the guide like it would be more suitable for our children's age group. Sadly, this wasn't the case. We went on the slinky dog ride (30 minute wait) and the Flying Carpet ride (45 minute wait) but the 90 minute wait on the other rides put us off! We then watched the Stars and Cars parade of 14 cars at 4pm. The children, seemingly completely underwhelmed, said  Please can we go back to the hotel now and have a swim!?!  So we left!I had previously been to Disneyland Florida with a friend and her children, but went with an open mind. I was expecting a lot of rides to be unsuitable for the children as they are young and haven't been on rides before. I am used to the concept of the ridiculous queues (although Florida seem to make it more enjoyable). I was not expecting great quality food. I also knew we were unlikely to see the Disneyland Park parade or evening show as they are simply too late for the children (7pm and 10pm respectively). I am not afraid of paying the price for a good service and quality product   however, in my opinion, Eurodisney offers neither. As other reviewers have also noted   Eurodisney completely lacks the Disney magic experience that usually makes it palatable to pay the high prices. We won't be back.",Disneyland_Paris
37439,233086900,5,2014-9,South Africa,"Yes, some people will not agree with me! Yes, I am sure that some people think that some of the other Disney parks are better and brighter and bigger! We (myself, my wife and our 9 year old son) enjoyed it tremendously. It was our first visit to any park this big and it was absolutely amazing. We had tickets for four days and we spent most of all four days between the Disney park and the Walt Disney Studio Park next door. We had an absolute blast and I will recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun.I have read some of the other reviews and we must have visited a different place than what I read about. I must admit however that as an example I do not give a hoot for Halloween decorations so however much there was I couldn't care less! Yes   some of the rides were not working, but we found that over the four day period of our visit 90% of the rides were working and available.I must concur that the food and drinks are very expensive, but we are from South Africa where such things are relatively cheap when compared to the rest of the World. The fact that it is expensive is however not different to the rest of Paris. We made a plan however and packed our own lunches! This meant that we had almost total control over the expense and also about what we wanted to eat.We surely didn't find many rude people. One or two at the most, but these you will find anywhere in the World. I think that the attitude with which one approaches a visit to a place like this determines the level of joy that one actually derives from such a visit.",Disneyland_Paris

Definitely didn't have time to see it all in one day. Only disappointment, only four separate occasions rides were temporarily shut down for 45 minutes!

We stayed for two nights and three days at the Hotel Du Moulon, which was great value for money and close to Disneyland. The highlight of our stay was the Walt Disney Studios. Unfortunately, by the third day we had to rush to see everything, so I would suggest three nights and four days to do and see all. We went in May, which I would recommend to all, as the lines on most rides were not very long and the weather is also good.Colleen Smit",Disneyland_Paris

Need to walk a lot (we walked 29 kms) that day so please dress comfortably. Disney parade was exquisite. Lots of eating options. Theme wise areas were great with all sorts of options of rides, activities, shows. The mickey mouse show (with all the other cartoon characters) at the castle was very good. Only two disappointing things were that few rides were not working and there was a huge crowd. Fireworks in the evening was amazingly beautiful and should not be missed!",Disneyland_Paris
16943,329454067,5,2015-11,Australia,"We visited Disneyland on 24th & 25th November 2015. We stayed at the Hilton Anaheim.Tickets are expensive, but there is a lot of value in them compared to other theme parks.We purchased a 2 Day park hopper pass as we did not know what we would need and it was recommended to us. I have no regrets with that decision, the park hopper when understood, is an awesome tool to maximising your ride experiences.The park is amazing! So much to see and do. Unfortunately, if you are not a fan of big crowds, this is not the place for you. Expect to share your day with 50,000 strangers all trying to do what you want to do.A key learning for everyone is the Fast Pass system. Fast passes are FREE. It took us a full day to figure this one out. Go to the Fast Pass distribution machines first thing in the morning and pre book the rides you want to do later in the day. At Disneyland you can get a fast pass every 2 hours. If you plan it right, you can wait in a queue, do a ride, and fast pass a ride (queue bypass). The Fast Pass system is seperated at California Park, so if you have a hopper pass, you can cross back and forward doing rides on the system.The food and souvenirs are actually reasonably priced as opposed to Australian theme parks. That being said, I preferred to leave the park and go to Denny's across the road for dinner as it is not crazy busy there and you can escape.I had a ball, just looking around and taking my time. There is so much detail and free things to do. The parades are amazing as are the fireworks.I loved Disneyland. I would certainly come back!",Disneyland_California
28736,32547785,2,missing,United States,"Let me first say that I am a huge Disney fan and have been to the Land and the World many , many times. That said, my family and I just returned from a trip to So Cal and were disappointed in the changes that I noticed in the parks. First of all, I haven't been to Disneyland since 2003 but this trip I saw TRASH thrown down in attractions and cups left on benches and gum on the pillars. I have never in all the years I have been going to Disney seen anything like this before. I think it is probably a combination of things that has caused this. One, there were way to many people under the age of 20 without adults to influence their behavior and two, I think Disneyland is vastly under staffed. I was given a photopass card upon check in at the Grand Californian but over a 5 day visit found no photograghers in the parks. Disappointing to say the least.Finally, for my birthday we ate at the Napa Rose. The food sounded fantastic but was mediocre at best and VERY expensive. The food is better and cheaper and any number of restuarants in the World. I will not be returning to Disneyland any time soon.",Disneyland_California
28811,14042140,5,missing,Canada,"we have been to Disneyland in July, on our Honeymoon, and had no prblems, but we were not travelling with kids at that time. This time we wanted to have a winter getaway from the cold Canadian Winters. This time we went with our 9 & 11 year old...Our first day at Disneyland was Jan29th, right after the heavy rains that Socal had been having. It was a little cool, but sunny. Nothing that a bunny hug and wind breaker couldn't handle. We took a backpack along, and had filled it with snacks purchased outside the park ( muffins, trail mix, and some fruit plus water) and had no difficultities briging into the park. This also helped to put our coats in and out as we needed them as the temps changed throout the day. IT WAS GREAT! We got on most every ride our very first day, some 2 3 times. ( We did not do the Mark twain or Ship this first day ) We had our snacks, and ate our lunch at Tomorrowland which gave us large burgers and fires, for our money. We found all of the pop quite expenisve $3 a drink, so we only had 1 per day, and then rank water for the rest... Since the park closed at 8pm, we went out for supper afterwards. On the Friday, we started at Disneyland, did a couple of our favorite rides again, then headed over to California Adventure. Again, we walked up to and on most of the rides... We did Soaring, screaming, and Tower of terro 2 x each. Then finished the day up with the Electric parade. AS this park closed, we saw the crowds heading over to Disneyland, and decided to just go back to the Hotel instead. We were able to watch the fireworks from the Hotel.On Monday, we again hit Disneyland, and did our favorite rides again 2 3 times, and then to California Adventure. We did find it getting a bit busier towards the end of the day, but later learned that Google staff were starting to arrive for their Company Holiday, but we still rode screaming 3 times, and Tower Of Terror 4 times, before heading back over to Disneyland, to finish off with Space Mountain and a coupel of other rides.I highly recomment this time of year. I feel for those people who went at Christmas and only rode 3 rides per day... We rode each ride 3 x per day!!!If you are planning to be in the Anaheim area and do more than just Disneyland, I recommend the Southern California City Pass. It cost $237 for adults ( 10 and over) and $199f or 9 and under. For $910 we had 3 days at Disneyland California Adventure, 1 day each at Universal Studios , San Diego Zoo, and Sea World. There also is acoupon in the booklet for Grayline Tours to visit all 3 of those attractions ( univ, Zoo, and Sea world) for $79 per person. We stayed for 10 days, and flight( $2400), food($1200), accomodations($1000), attractions($910.00), souveniiers & Misc($500), transportation($450), and whatever else, cost us $6500 US....We did not feel deprived at all. We ate 1 meal ( lunch) at each of the attractions, and 1 meal (supper) in a restaurant. Our hotel had a continental breakfast which saved us $$ and allowed us to grab some muffins to pack for a snack and we took in our own water. Refill up your water bottles at the fountains available. we had 3 extra days to visit downtown disney and relax in the pool at the Hotel. The weather was a little cooler than we would have liked, but it didn't stop the kids from swimming in the pool. During the day we could get away with a long sleeve shirt, but did need a bunnyhug and coat for when it got dark.. Make sure you have good shoes!!!!Our trip was so much fun... and again, keep your eyes open, and do not just follow the crowd. We found on several occasions that we just looked there often was a shorter, faster route, esp at the restaurant lineups...Good luck, and have fun!",Disneyland_California
39817,159886788,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,Disney Dreams show was amazing. The food was very expensive and the merchandise.  It was a lot harder the meet characters in Disneyland park much easier in the studios.,Disneyland_Paris
36396,272498911,4,2015-5,United Kingdom,"4 night trip with the family (2 adults, 2 children   3 year old girl & 6 year old boy).Stayed at Hotel Cheyenne Restaurants   Chuck Wagon (Hotel Cheyenne), Blue Lagoon, Cafe Mickey, Rainforest Cafe, Auberge de Cendrillon.The hotel was absolutely fine for our purpose. Somewhere to sleep and shower. It's based upon a wild west theme, with the apartment blocks named after wild west characters and places. The room was clean, if a little tired, and had maid service every day.The inclusive continental breakfast at the Chuck Wagon is ok, but gets very busy from 7.30am, so get there early to avoid queueing. We had dinner there on the first night, a buffet that is basic but with plenty of choice.We ate around the park the rest of the time   The Blue Lagoon restaurant (for dinner) was nice, if a little overpriced.Breakfast at Cafe Mickey was a bit of a let down, but that was mostly due to how busy it was, which meant that the premium paid for a relaxed, unhurried place to meet characters was wasted. The Rainforest Cafe for dinner was as expected, great service, decent food at a price that was comparable to the same restaurant in London.Lunch at Auberge de Cendrillon was a fantastic experience for the children, and worth every cent.Overall the park was better than I had anticipated, with lots to keep children occupied all the time. Sure there are rides that are closed, but the park is 20 years old and never closes, so that is to be expected.Queues for rides can be very long, but the Fastpass system works well if you put in a little planning at the start of each day.There are rides for all ages (based upon height), with Fantasyland being the area with most little one's rides. The characters are excellent. You can either queue to meet them for free, pay for a meal at a few restaurants where you can meet them, or if you're lucky you'll bump into them around the park as they go between character meeting points.Spiderman in the Backlot of the studios park is well worth a visit, he is very interactive. My son went dressed as Spiderman, and got lots of time with him, loads of photos and his autograph. He really is very good. But then so are the other characters we met.The parade is fantastic, and worth getting a place for early. We watched from a few places and found the best to be the outer curve of the roundabout in front of the castle. During the parade on our final day, Peter Pan and Prince Phillip (Sleeping Beauty's prince), both of whom we had met earlier in the day, recognised our children and waved at them.TIP   if you are taking a boy, get him to dress up (Disney character or superhero), hardly any boys dress up so they really get noticed by cast members and characters. Lots of girls are dressed up as princesses, but in 4 days we saw maybe 10 boys dressed up.",Disneyland_Paris

They have their own Disney train, complete with Mickey Mouse windows, that you can ride from Sunny Bay station going to Disneyland. If you are staying in HongKong central or Tsim Sha Tsui, it is a one hour ride and you have transfer trains. Before you enter the main gate to Disneyland Theme Park, there is a luggage storage area at the side so you could leave your things though I'm not sure if it's free. You can also but food for a much cheaper price outside, and of course, eat it there before going in. We availed our ticket from the host of our hostel and got it for a cheaper price and we were able to skip the long ticketing lines.Once you got in, you may get the map and attraction schedules on the side. This will help you decide where to go first and what time are the shows and parades. We went there on a Friday so the line wasn't long. Toy Story attractions are more about rides and I suggest you visit that place first. There are restaurants inside Disneyland and they are expensive. About HK$130 for a full meal. But we got a discount coupon from the airport (Go to the tourism board booth) and we got 20% off on the meal we bought. The servings were big and good enough for 2 so you can share. The best place to watch the parade is on Main Street USA, beside the cafe. Check the schedule of the parade. When we went there last April, we watched the production of Lion King and it was really great. Don't miss out on watching these shows. Staff inside Disneyland give out stickers for free. If they don't give you one, you can ask them. The stickers are good souvenir and it's free! You can also ask them to take your pictures. Walking around Disneyland is tiring so don't forget to bring water and wear comfy shoes. For those who are wondering, it's HK$50 for a mickey mouse or ironman waffle. The ice cream is for HK$30.Don't forget to watch the fireworks display!",Disneyland_HongKong

However, we did not go on either Cars or Hyperspace Mountain as the wait times for both of those was around 2HRS all day long (I guess if you really want to go on these you don't really have a choice but to wait). But in order to maximize our time and fun we did get a park hopper pass and relied heavily on the smart phone app to tell us which rides had the shortest wait times so we just had fun bouncing around.

THe food was not good, thats why we decided to eat the second night out in a small town 20 km outside the parc. We should have done this the first evening as well.The rooms were ok, but what really bothered me was the fact that we had to pay for absolutely everything ; there was no minebar in the room and the price for water in the machines in the corridors was way too expensive. The little packages of coffee needed to be paid.But then again; you dont go to euro disney for the hotels of course.Restaurants in the park could work out expensive with long queues and all the food is fast food. SO if you are not a fan of fast food ; bring your own lunch,The rides themselves in the park although could have long queues at times their fairly well organised and move quickly, just a shame some rides are over with even quicker. There's something there for young and old and they do a family service too. There's small rides in boats like It's a small world, or rollercoasters like Space Mountain just depending on your likes and dislikes.There's plenty of shows to see at different times of the day but remember if you go in winter remember to wear your winter woollies to keep you warm as some of the shows are outside. At this time of year there's two parades one is of the Disney characters at about 4pm and the other at 7pm which is The light display where all the floats are lit up.

If you like Disney, even if you have been to the other parks, you will probably have a good time. (We have been to Disneyland in California, Florida and Tokyo. And, we had a really fun day at Hong Kong Disneyland). If you have been to a Disney park before, one full day is enough. We were there for 7 hours and did pretty much everything we wanted to. (Would have liked to stay longer for fireworks, etc., but had a flight to catch). We went on Sunday, November 27, a sunny day, and the lines were not bad. Compared to lines at other Disney parks, these lines are pretty short. (Fast Pass only for Winnie the Pooh and Hyperspace Mountain). But, you need to plan your time.We checked in and left our luggage for the Airport Express station in Kowloon, went to the park on the MTR and then straight to the airport on the MTR. Only took about 40 minutes from when we walked out the gate to when we walked in to the airport.While similar to other Disney parks, it has it's own special things. The Festival of the Lion King Show was excellent.Mystic Point is unique. Grizzley Gulch Mine Cars was unexpectedly good.There are discounts available, so purchase in advance.

I'm a traveler and I finally decided to come here but you pay a log for only two rides , yes that's ride by the time you go to park your car and the entrance of the theme park you have waisted 2 hrs and 5 lines . This is the most expensive park and I won't recommend , there are other sites in California for your kids to visit . You will spend about 1500 dlls with accommodations and tickets just for only one day . There is Santa Monica and other theme parks with less headaches and more organize in California. Disneyland is just overrated for the kind of money you spend in here . Please keep your money and take your kids to see a Disneyland show instead they would enjoy it more . ",Disneyland_California

Go to the back of California experience.Where you can buy salad and soup in bread bowls. You can see a short film about making bread and see it being made after the film. Make sure you buy a Mickey bread for the kids. Where else could you buy this bread. And the kids will have a great time eating Mickey's ears.",Disneyland_California

Of course the latest is iron man which is really awesome (has a  free  tour around HK) plus exhibition of good to be true technologies, which kids and teens will love. Expect long queues as usual so plan ahead. If you want to ride as many attractions as possible, be at the site before opening as large crowd usually comes around noon. Suggest to take iron man, hyperspace mountain, lion king, rc racer and runaway mine cars as these where usually the long lines are. Watching parades is a must so suggest to be at the main street prolly 30 mins before the parade starts coz they attract crowd. The ending (fireworks display) is really a must see. This is where you will feel that you are a disney kid. Food: there's limited variety of food and they are really pricey (everything in disney is pricey). Try korean squid . Ticket: got my discounted ticket from klook which is very convenient and efficient. I avoided a long queue for ticket and went directly to the main entrance. ",Disneyland_HongKong

As with other members I had read quite negative reviews about it, but I thought it was fantastic! We went at the end of May on a week day and so it was so quiet you didn`t have to queue for any of the rides. This meant that as big kids we could go on the horses, the tea cups and the boat rides time and time again if you wanted. You probably wouldn`t want any longer here than a day or two at the most as the park isn`t massive, but it is enough to give you a disney experience!",Disneyland_HongKong

It is easier than buying them through the Disney website.We took the MTR and transferred to the Disney Line. The Disney experience starts with Disney Line. This train is pretty cool with Mickey shaped windows and hand holds. We can see the excitement in the kids riding this train! There is a little bit of walking from the training station to the park entrance. There were two food trucks on the way to the park entrance so you can stop to eat before or after visiting the park. The park itself is smaller than Disneyland or Disney World. That is a plus because we didn't get as tired going through the park. The Star War tour has been converted to an Iron Man Experience which we dubbed the  Stark Tour.  We always enjoy this ride. There is no Haunted Mansion here, instead they have the Mystic Manor ride. We loved it. The character creation, back stories, and animation is exceptional. This has become my daughter's favorite ride. There are many more of the fun disney rides. They have churros! We watched the parade in the afternoon and later the electric lights parade at night.Disneyland have buses to go to the resort hotels; but it is back where the train stop is; so it is quite a walk to get there. So be sure to plan ahead on the rides and getting to the resorts if you are having lunch there. Overall, a very enjoyable experience! We really liked the new rides. ",Disneyland_HongKong

We arrived before opening and tried to make a beeline for the fastpass to Radiator Springs Racers, but so did everyone else in the park!! The line for the fastpasses was around the block! With just me and my 12 year old we could not spilt up and have him ride something while I waited in line. We went to the ride itself to see the wait...HUGE...wow! So we checked out the single rider line. Best thing we ever did. We ended up waiting about 15 minutes (keep in mind the park had just opened). And we got lucky that we were in the same car. He was right in front of me. It was fun! We had a great time in both parks. I was disappointed at the amount of rides closed for refurbishment, several big rides. And both Matterhorn and Space Mountain closed at times due to 'difficulties'. We waited for an hour for Space Mountain and the ride got shut down. We were told it would be over an hour before it would be back up. No one was offered a fast pass or anything after that long wait. At the very end of the night we noticed (via an app I had) it was finally back up. We went running over (and so did everyone else..lol) and we waited another 45 min for a ride.So...it was Disney, it was fun! But exhausting fun!",Disneyland_California

Be sure to take a stroller because there is plenty of walking and stroller parking outside the activity areas are available. It is best to take a 2 day pass if you have the time because to cover such a vast area in a day is not possible. The queues for photos with Mickey and Minnie are huge... You get a photo pass card wherein can log in online and view the photo and buy it (keep in mind till you dont buy u cannot even download the photo!) Its a small world ,  Winnie the pooh ,  Mystic manor  are the attractions i really enjoyed. Even the  Cinderella Carousel  was awesome. The queues are huge but the good part is that the wait time is displayed outside the ride so u can decide if u want to go or not.Try and go on a weekday because weekends are super crowded. The parades are beautiful and the firework display is also not to be missed. You can access Disneyland from Tung Chung MTR and also bus stop is there.If you staying in the Disney hotels then the shuttle bus goes every 5 7 minutes. Even if you but tickets in advance and get the soft copy, you still have to queue up at the ticketing counter to get the entry pass.Look out on the Disney website for deals and discounts... the one day pass is for 539 HKD and i got a deal of 599 HKD for a 2 day pass.. so do remember to check for offers.There are plenty of restaurants and gift shops.

Every spot can be accessed easily without the need to walk too far. Thank you for all the cast members for being so professional (except for one or two) especially under the hot weather. However, I would like to suggest Disneyland to install misting system in the park before the hot summer comes. It's only May but it gets quite hot already and I can't imagine how it's like in Jun Sep. The hot weather may lower people's interests in visiting the park. I remember that when I went to theme parks in other countries, they have misting system which helps cool guests down. Maybe they should consider that too. Also, I think they should place more canopies along the pathways so that guests can take a rest from the sun during the summer.

Now, I am not old, just 60, but my joints no longer appreciate the long walks on hard pavement.  Last week, we returned to Disneyland, this time with young grandchildren (ages 5,3 & 7 mos) diaper bags, backpacks, etc. We rented two scooters the first day and three the second and third...not just for me. It meant that a daughter with health issues could stay with us all day. Anyway, we could carry the kids on our laps, carry the backpacks, speed around. It was great. This year we rented the scooters where we stayed, at the Ramada Inn, across from the park and were able to drive them over to the park and back home again.

Absolutely worth it to buy this deal as you get to exchange for set meals of prices HKD120 & above each for lunch & dinner, plus a snack. The Mickey Minnie ice cream will cost you HKD39 & popcorn HKD32 35. You do the math! We never even got to use the HKD5 discount for water coupon, as we got bottled water with the set meals anyways (if you don't take soda, coffee tea add HKD10).All the attractions were great fun and our most recommended would be:1) Mystic Manor (the only one in the world!)2) Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh3) Mickey's Philharmonic4) It's a Small World5) Slinky Dog Spin6) Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (not for the faint hearted!)We covered more than 11 attractions right up to the fireworks at 8.30pm.

9942,645826659,5,2018-2,Canada,"We visited Disneyland and California Adventure Park as a family (for the first time) in Feb 2018 from Sunday to Wednesday with a 4 day park hopper pass and it was such a great time for all of us. We had our three children with us ages 7, 7, and 10. We're about to return again in Feb 2019, so I'll share my recommendations and some things I learned from our first visit. I definitely feel that HOW we did Disneyland had a huge impact on our overall experience...My thoughts on how to make the most of Disney with kids...  Be prepared if it's your first time. Read every blog, watch every YouTube clip, and know what you're getting into. Some may think this would ruin Magic, but I learned so much and felt so much more prepared and efficient when I arrived for the first time. I also asked my kids to make a Wish List of their top 10 rides attractions, so that when we were there we could make those things our priority and not waste time walking around.  Arrive early. Even if it's tough to get the little ones out of bed early, it is SO worth it! The crowds are light in the morning and we had the most fun getting there early and beating the lines. We rode all the most popular rides before noon (before it got too crowded). Take a break mid day. I cannot stress how beneficial this way for us. We knew our kids would want to stay late into the night, but we also knew they would be exhausted and cranky. So, we left the park each day around 1pm, ate at a less expensive restaurant outside the resort, walked back to our hotel and had a nap. Yes, we had a nap! Our kids do not typically nap and despite the complaints on the first day, even they came to agree that it was a good idea. None of us had any trouble sleeping for 1.5 hours and then getting up to return to the park around 4pm.  Take extra shoes. A lot of blogs recommend wearing comfy shoes. I recommend taking a few pairs of shoes and changing throughout the day, if possible. I don't think it matters how comfortable your shoes are, your feet will get tired and sore in any shoes after that much walking.  Stay close by. In 2018, we stayed at Grand Legacy, which was great. This year, we've chosen the Best Western across the street from the gates. We didn't want to rent a car and worry about parking. It is worth the extra $$ to be able to leave the park and return to the hotel throughout the day. From Grand Legacy, it was an 11 min walk. Awesome! We also just go bus transfers (through LUX Bus) to and from LAX. It was so much easier and must less stressful than trying to navigate traffic and directions. Simplify wherever possible :)  Pack light for the parks. My husband took a small backpack and I carried a purse. It was so nice not to be bogged down. With older kids, it's easier to pack light. I remember the days with babies and that is a whole different story! All we packed was water, autograph books, portable phone chargers (a must if you're using the app!), and light sweaters for evening.  Use MaxPass and the Disneyland App. MaxPass saves so much time and includes the photopass. Use the Fast Pass for the most popular rides. We hardly had to wait in line at all. With the app, we made dining reservations, checked wait times... everything. Also, if using the app, take a portable battery pack. Your phone will go dead and Disney sells them for around $30 US dollars.  If characters are important to your family, try a character dinner. We ate at Goofy's kitchen and it was a blast. Up close and personal with the characters and our kids got their autograph books signed. The food was pretty good too. It's a buffet with something for everyone.These are the things I felt made our trip great. Disneyland really is magical, but it can also be very tiring and overwhelming (for both grown ups and kids, alike), so you'll be glad you did whatever you could do to get ahead of the game. We had a great time as a family and can't wait to return next month!",Disneyland_California
13695,449608594,4,2016-12,United States,".....is absolutely beautiful but remember the crowds of . Try to stay at the Disneyland properties so that you get the extra magic hour and get in early to ride . We e rode and rode rides for a the first part of the day and then when it became crowded we would take a break at the hotel. Then come back later. Use the Fast Passes to ride super crowded rides so you can go ride other people things while you wait for your time to ride. The staff at he park are fine. I've gone to the park for 30 years and they ebb and flow on their staff and courteous behavior .We had a few rude moments. When using a fast pass at Indiana Jones, the girl barked  it's not your time  My husband looked at our passes and then she looked again  oh, my bad   she said and moved us on. Very odd for Disney. At Peter Pan we were there a few people back from the first to ride it for the day and I heard th girl bark at the little family at the front  your going to have to wait  I thought for most people they don't come here often, it's there first ride of the day o their trip with their little children and they are being barked at. not to mention how much they pay for the pleasure . So just preparing you. Mostly it's ok ( not like it use to be but ok) We will be back as always . ",Disneyland_California

39784,161091651,3,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Our trip was May 9th   13th family of 5 (Wife, 4yr old daughter, myself and my parents)Arriving just after 2pm we checked into the hotel and returned back to the park just to have a look around before getting a full day in on the Friday. First impressions were good, the park is a good copy of the US parks (I've been to the one in California well over 20 times so I know it very well) After spending a couple of hours we returned to the hotel (Santa Fe) as my mum has trouble walking (uses a walker) we waited for the shuttle bus. This was our first taste of just how RUDE the Europeans can be (I don't want to point fingers but it's mainly the French) after the 15 minutes wait the amount of people wanting to get the bus was pretty big but we were at the front waiting in the disabled area so didn't think this would be a problem, how wrong can you be, we were pushed out of the way (me holding my 4yr old) my mum struggling to step into the bus, I just couldn't believe the people around us showing no respect for the less abled people. This was like it eveytime we used the shuttle, my mum dreaded using it if it was busy.Friday was our first full day in the park and the rudeness continued, what was worse it was coming from the Disney staff members. My mum decided to hire a wheelchair (50 euros a day, 150 euros deposit) she was told to go to city hall to get a pass which would allow her and one other member of the family to go on the rides at the exit. So went to city hall only to be told that she must provide proof that she is disabled, she's not officially disabled so she doesn't have a badge or letter from her doctor, so they refused to give her the pass. So if you   re thinking of hiring a wheelchair then make sure you have a letter from your doctor to get the pass.The rides are great although the Q times they advertise at the entrance you might as well double, 25 mins for peter pans flight turned into an hour. There was one thing that really made me mad and that was constant people smoking in the lines, the park operates a no smoking policy allowing 11 smoking areas around the park, the amount of times i had smoke blown in my direction, and it was clear the staff didn't care either.We left the park during the afternoon, when returning I was helping my daughter through the barriers, when me and my daughter were pushed aside by a member of staff so she could put through the tickets of a couple because their child was in a pushchair, there was no need to rush them through, they could have waited like everyone else, to say I was angry was an understatement, this is supposed to be a magical place yet so far I   ve been pushed around, treated like rubbish and being turned into a passive smoker. I was staring to realised if you can't beat them join them, so apart from taking up smoking i started treating people the same way as I was being treated, this seemed to work and the day got better. We wanted to watch the Disney Dreams show that started at 22:30 so found a good spot at 8pm and waited, by 21:30 people were trying to push their way in front of us even looking at me and shaking their heads because i wasn't letting them in front, you just have to be strong and stand your ground, the place is big enough so everyone can see the show. It was a great show on the castle and is a MUST see.Saturday we went into Disney studios (see other review) coming back into the park for dinner. Sunday was so much better, being a weekend I thought the park was going to be really busy but is wasn't if anything it seemed empty, we got to go on loads of rides and had a great day, my mum decided not to hire a wheelchair with all the hassle from last time and just used her walker, when we tried to go on some rides staff stopped her and asked for her pass, when we said city hall refused to give her one they called down to the operator on the ride who always gave her the ok for her to proceed, we got to do things as a family which we couldn't do on the Friday. The parades were great, 20 year anniversary every hour from midday (this is a little train that stops in front of the castle and all the characters get off and meet all the kids for 20 mins before getting back on and heading down main street USA) The other parade is at 7pm.To sum up, would I go back, only if I had to, I'm now looking at going to Disney in Florida, Paris is good but to have every ride in French, if you can't understand the language you   re just wondering what is going on. Yes sometimes you get the odd bit of English but it's not enough. Every now and then i thought this is just like the US Disney, but the French just killed it for me.I will go back one day, my daughter absolutely loved it and we did see a lot of characters, I would have rated it better if it wasn't for the rude staff and the people smoking everywhere, the park should police this more.TIPSBuy the meal vouchers when booking your holiday, food is expensive, the buffet meals cost 26 euros for adults and 13 for kids. If you do get the vouchers pick your restaurants and book a table as they will fill up fast, we booked our tables at the reception desk of our hotel. I got a great tip from trip advisor, I took an empty water bottle and just filled in up at any of the water fountains that can be found at the entrances to the toilets. Saved buying water or soft drinks and saved money.Take lots of spending money, the shops are fantastic, between the wife and daughter we nearly had to buy a new suitcase.",Disneyland_Paris
8279,152069576,4,2012-9,Australia,"Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely smaller than the one in Anaheim but that doesn't detract from its charm. It's definitely a family oriented theme park so if you are looking for big thrill rides you will be disappointed. It's very easy to get to on the MTR as it has its own designated line.Disneyland was getting ready for Halloween so there were skeletons, tomb stones and cob webs everywhere. We had arrived early to beat the crowds (and heat) so could wander at our leisure up Main Street and visit each of the 'Lands'. No matter how old you are you will always enjoy a ride on the tea cups!! There were plenty of shady areas and stands selling cold drinks. We had lunch at the Castle which was an air conditioned haven. The food was pretty average but you could choose from pizza, burgers, salads and grills. The crowds grew as the day progressed. Unfortunately so did the bus loads of tourists from Mainland China who were very pushy and rude. They obviously have no knowledges of queues as they just barged in front of people. A shame as you shouldn't have to fight for a place in a line.The souvenir shops were well stocked with all sorts of Disney memorabilia and there were plenty of photo opportunities with Disney characters.

It hasn't changed. You know exactly what you'll get with Disney   saccharine sweetness, Christmas music in November and a brilliant set of rides.We turned up pretty much as soon as it opened and stayed until it closed. A surprising number of rides we expected to be popular (Aerosmith Rock 'n' Roller and Space Mountain 2) had wait times of less than five minutes,and we went on everything we intended to   the highlight being, as with my first visit, a go on the Tower of Terror   a standard drop ride made exciting by the acting skills of the staff and a brilliant set up.In all honesty though, the site is looking a little tired. We ate Beef Tacos in one of the cafes in Adventureland and it looked pretty run down. There are a few rides that need a bit of a lick of paint, and it doesn't meet the perfecting standards that you expect from Disney   especially considering how expensive it is. I'll refuse the temptation of calling it a Mickey Mouse operation. Damn. I failed.So, great fun, great rides, good value for money, but probably not worth another visit until they tidy it up and get some more stuff in.

30750,561608858,5,2018-2,United Kingdom,"I first visited Disneyland Paris in May 2013, My daughter was then 4. Now aged 9, I decided to treat her and make a 2nd visit. I remember what it was like on my first visit so was preparing myself for pretty much the same rude treatment, people smoking and long Q's for the rides.Well i hold my hands up things have changed for the better. We went during half term Feb 12th   16th, and too my surprise the Q times were pretty good, I think the most time we waited was 40 45 mins for a ride, most of the ride times advertised 25 30 mins, we even managed to get through quicker sometimes.My biggest problem when i visited in 2013 was the amount of attractions that were in french, we built the euro tunnel to make it easier and quicker for the brits french to visit each other I thought the park should accommodate the english language more. I'm happy to say they do now, all the parades were a mixture of french and english, as was Pirates of the Caribbean and buzz lightyear lazer blast. The park announcements were in about 4 different languages. But my biggest surprise was Star Tours, this ride was always in french and as good as the ride is you walked off thinking what were they saying, we went on the ride 4 times over our visit and on the 4th ride the whole thing was in english, I've found out from the disneyland paris facebook page that star tours has 11 different videos so really nearly every time you ride you should get a different experience but of course the language will be random, probably favoring the french language.I brought the half board meal tickets because the park is expensive for food. This hasn't changed. Just to give you an idea, a roll and drink cost 12 euros, in the main restaurants they give you meal options 1 6 these meals cost 16 or 17 euro (Burger chips drink & pudding) that is just a ridiculous amount of money, because they are set meals everything is all pre set up and just sitting under heat lamps, the burgers are very poorly put together. The buffet restaurants an adult price is about 33 euros. There are plenty of characters to see, although none of them walk around the park, they all have their designated area to stand, the Q's for this is understandably very long, a lot of guests have an autograph book which just adds more waiting time and also depending on the character they tend to have a little play with the kids, which although frustrating to watch, when it comes to your turn you lap it up and take your time, some have a professional photographers but you can also take your own pictures and the staff are more than willing to take pictures for you so everyone can be in the picture.During our visit we did nearly every ride in the park, doing big thunder mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean & star tours 4 times each. I would say don't bother with mad hatters tea cups, it seems that they leave the brakes half on, i'm a nutter when it comes to these spinning rides and i could hardly move it, nearly putting my back out trying.My first review of disney I only gave it 3 stars (average) after my 2nd visit i'm changing it to 5, although the food is still very expensive. Also with many people changing to vaping rather than smoking, there was very little smoking and vaping for that matter in the park, this made the experience a lot more enjoyable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I'm still missing the place and can't wait to go back.",Disneyland_Paris

We had been to Disneyland six years ago and decided to go back due to all the new rides since we last went (Crush Coaster, Toy Story Land, Tower of Terror, Buzz ride etc).Reading all the recent mixed reviews I thought blimey the place has gone downhill since I last went, but how wrong could I be.Yes it was cold, very cold but dry, would rather be cold than wet. We stayed at Hotel Cheynne in two rooms which Reception put us side by side and we had adjoring room doors which was ideal. The rooms were perfect for us to use. Even a free to use Safe. Breakfast is a mad rush but we expceted that. Dont be British and Q, just go in and get your stuff   everyone else does.Shuttle rides to the park frequent and ideal.We made use of the early entrance time and managed to do all the kiddie rides, Space mountain and Buzz all in the two hours. We stayed in the park until 9pm on Sat and Sun and the park is empty   everyone pretty much goes home after six. We did the entire park in 3 hours ideal.As a family we prefer the Disney Studios, the shows are amazing, make sure you see Stich Live, but ensure you see the English show!! Dont miss that. Animagic and Cinemagic were also both very good. Make sure you see them.Our youngest (7 years 1.25m) loved the Aerosmith Rollercoaster   was her fave ride and rode it 8 times over the 4 days there.Eating, prices as you would expect, but they have range from cheap to stupid expensive. We ate at the Over the Counter restaurants, and the food was lovely.   2.99 for a bottle of coke is a rip off mind you.....Overall, we had a great time and would deffo return.

We took my two children aged 11 and 8 yrs, and they both still had the 'wow' factor at it all, plus they were tall enough to enjoy all the rides except for possibly two which is a bonus when you're paying out so much for the tickets, that being said there are plenty of rides for the smaller ones to enjoy, Peter Pan and Small world being favourites. The best rides to aim for first thing in Disneyland are Buzz Lazer Blast, and the Phantom Manor and take a fast pass for Thunder Mountain and Star Tours as they queues are very long for these two. Also when we went the park was open til 10pm and rides which had horrendous queues in the daytime were practically non existent in the evening, down to something like ten mins so it's worth leaving the popular rides til late evening (check closing hours at the park tho). In Walt Disney Studios head straight for Crush's coaster which was brilliant, there's no fast pass on this so you have to get in early to beat the queues, definately worth a couple of rides on is the Aerosmith Rock'n rollercoaster which quietened the kids down for a bit! : ) We went for 3 nights and had two full days in the parks which was about right. We stayed at the Kyriad (an off site hotel with free shuttle) which still had a new fresh clean feel to it and a bar you could have a drink at later. The queues from hotels like the Santa Fe for the Shuttle bus where large, whereas we just were able to jump on the shuttle bus easily due to the hotel being nowhere near as huge and not having so many people to cater for. Disneyland at night is amazing with the pink castle all lit up and it will give you and your kids something to remember for a very long time. Food is expensive, walking around there are hot dog stands which come in at around 7Euros 50 for hot dog and drink or there abouts, so we ate well at breakfast, and then at 4.30 (to avoid food queues) treated ourselves at the Rainforest cafe in Disney Village well worth a visit, a quick turn around at the hotel, and then back into disney for some more action. We paid 20 euros per adult for main meal and a desert, and the kids menu for drink, main and desert was around 12 euros so with our drinks around 75 euros just to give you an idea.

1894,521096792,5,2017-9,Singapore, We went on a Sunday. The average waiting time for each ride is about 5 10 minutes. The queue for photography with the Disney characters can be up to an hour long. Most rides are suitable for children.  The fireworks show at 8.30pm is spectacular and a must do activity. You can get a stamp on your arm and return to Disneyland after dinner or a short rest.

21849,211581116,3,2014-5,United States,"We mainly went for the Carsland part of California Adventureland because that is not available in Orlando. The first ride we went on, I had never seen so many line cutters   that was the main cars attraction. I'm told it's one of the more popular rides.I saw a lot of line cutting all over the park in general and in 20 years of going to amusement parks, including major parks in other states, I had never seen that except for here. Apparently they offer locals an annual pass that amounts to $1.50 a day but charge vistors and out of towners about $150 for same thing. I can see why it's over priced. It's really more just for the locals but the lines are very long   even just to see the Disney characters like Mickey or Buzz Lightyear   the line was too long for my little ones to stand. For one of the lines to meet Buzz we left because it's outdoors with no shade and at least a fifteen minute wait   they would have gotten sun burnt.It was a good experience but entirely too overpriced and WAY too overcrowded. It was a shame really.If there is something there you need to see, I would go but plan your trip out and know what you want to do. If you are doing either space mountain or the Lightning McQueen cars race ride, get the fast pass early and go back to the ride later. People blatantly pass you up (pretending to look for a friend when they just don't want to wait in line so they cut to the front).......it's not a great experience.Again   if you are looking for something specific to that park, then go there but if you just want an amusement park experience, go somewhere else. It's cheaper and most likely a lot less crowded.",Disneyland_California

28717,37942696,5,missing,United States,"It was so much fun! Went with boyfriend, and as two adults, we were able to race through the park and see everything. We downloaded and used the Ridemax software, which got us way ahead of schedule and we were able to get way ahead of schedule and see most of the park in one day! As anyone knows, Disneyland is a magical experience. I do have to say, though, that the staff was less friendly than I remember. While we never had any direct negative interactions, I witnessed  cast members  being almost surly with guests on several differnent occasions. This was disappointing, but we still had a great time! I recommend a few things: 1.) Share food when you can   if you split a sandwhich or pretzel, it cuts your costs in half. I was suprised that we actually stayed within our food budget using this method. 2.) Invest in the Ridemax software. I was skeptical, but it was only $14.95 month and it seemed to save us a huge amount of time. I will get it again the next time I go. 3.) Careful of the water. As out of towners, we both got a little ill after a few days of refilling our waterbottles in the park. I have since talked to friends who experienced the same thing. In all fairness, it is probably just not being used to the water in So. CA rather than Disneyland itself. 4.) Learn the fast pass system. The Ridemax software helped us with this. (No, I'm not affiliated with them or anything; I was just way impressed!) 5.) It's ok to take breaks! Looking back, one of my favorite parts of the prark was just fooling around on Tom Sawyer Island and sitting and watching the boats go by, rather than rushing to get in line for another ride. 6.) If you are going to be there for more than two days, be sure to take care of your feet! I am a regular walker, and even alternating two comfy pairs of tennis shoes, my feet were really sore by the third day, and they just got worse. I wouldn't try this in sandals! 7.) Don't take anything too seriously. We saw quite a few heated arguments about what ride to do next or where to eat or where to stand, etc, instead of people just enjoying whatever they were doing. Just have fun!",Disneyland_California

35579,301922119,5,2015-8,United Kingdom,"We stayed in august 2015. We travelled down in our campervan and stayed in the Disneyland carpark for 5 nights. You park in pinochio carpark, it is quite a long walk to the park   be warned don't forget anything!Parking is free with an annual pass or 30 Euros a day. We showed our pass at carpark booth and they issued an A4 sheet and reciept to display in window. We had photocopied one of our passes and simply.left this and the Disney sheet in our window, no need to get a new ticket everyday unless you need to pay.The toilets and showers are OK. Not great but OK for free. The showers are very very hot though so be careful. There is grey waste disposal and water taps to refil your tank. There's also a toilet disposal point and bins for rubbish.Overall its fine for a few nights stay, and a bargain if you have the annual pass. We bought annual passes last year for 4 for   400. We have had two holidays by buying them late august the first yr then holidaying early august this yr.We really enjoyed Disney, its our 5th trip so all my tips for that can be found in my earlier reviews",Disneyland_Paris

Some of the parc is being currently upgraded so few rides and attractions were closed. This gives us an opportunity to go back in a few years time. This is probably why i didnt give the parc 4 stars.Some of fast food wasnt great and our french fries were always luke warm. Would visit again.,Disneyland_Paris
35619,300379485,2,2015-8,United Kingdom,"We went for just a day to Disneyland only, it started well seeing the frozen show straight away which was fin for us all. However things went downhill from there, with two big rides closed with mechanical problems and queues over an hour. Even the ice cream stand took 30 minutes with only one counter out of 4 open. My tips would be to arrive early for park opening at 1000Get a free fast pass ticket immediately, that way you may get two in that day.Think about booking a restaurant, or plan to eat in the village afterwards were there are larger restaurants.They let you picnic which is good and there are plenty of water fountains.In Disneyland's favour we probably weren't an ideal family, with 3 children from 3 to 9, and not guests at the hotel. But to be honest I am relieved we weren't staying, as I don't feel it was good value for our family.The parade at 5.30 was good, and the staff friendly and helpful, even when the rides were broken.Leaves me feeling a bit like after a visit to McDonald's I won't be rushing back, and recommend you save your money for the films and toys.PS Thunder mountain with my eldest was fun, she closed her eyes the whole way around but insisted she loved it afterwards.",Disneyland_Paris

The longest wait was less than 10 minutes (miracle!!!)The park is much smaller that other disney (I heard because I have not been to others and most definitely won't ever  and we are from the U.S.) it was the right size for a 6 hour day trip for us. The staff members are not very friendly (not like what I have heard about those at other Disneys). They were certainly efficient but not super friendly. We saw the Lion King show and the 3D Donald duck movie and both were very impressive  a must see. The Grizzly mine car ride was our favorite. It was super fun and exciting we went back for more (because there was no lines!!!).,Disneyland_HongKong

Everything was amazing and I can't think of anything bad to say about it. I went in January so there wasn't huge lines and the weather was fine (cold, but not freezing and it only drizzled rain a few times) but this would obviously be variable. In my opinion is was definitely worth braving the slightly poor weather to escape the massive crowds. Prices are high, but you know that is going to be the case, it's Disneyland. There are plenty of ways you can avoid spending, bring prepacked lunches and snacks, all the attractions are free, and if you are bringing kids just don't take them into any of the shops!",Disneyland_Paris

This was only my third time to DL but by far my best! Reasons being: we went on a weekday (Fri), we arrived before the park opened, and we planned our visit in advance (which rides to go on first since we'd be there when it first opened, where to eat, etc). It was great to have a plan rather than just winging it as I usually do when going to a place like an amusement park. Thanks to good planning and effective use of Fast Passes (a must!), we rode every ride we wanted to ride as well as a few others (monorail, Casey Jr. train), we saw every attraction we wanted to see attend, and we ate when we wanted and where we wanted while staying within our budget.

This time it was the first time we were able to use Maxpass. It is an extra charge 15.00 I believe. But so worth it! It allowed us to get on the rides we wanted first thing and pick another pass before the other one came up. Difference is that you have to be in the park for it to work. Not like the free fast passes at Wdw that you pick before you arrive. We felt it made it much more attainable to get passes for too rides. We just had a day this trip, we love Haunted Mansion and got to see it with the Nightmare before Christmas layover. Love it! The Castle is so pretty , it would be great to take kids to see DL first then go to Wdw to see the reaction to the bigger castle.

The lines were also a bit better but still too long for me. The ride quality (Star Tours, Matterhorn, Pirates, Indy Jones) is good but don   t last long enough. Considering the $97 cost for a one day entry the entertainment value is now only fair. Still a great place to take kids because the waiting time for rides young ones would enjoy are much shorter.

15372,379924807,5,2016-4,Australia,"The first time I visited Disneyland I was 21 years old and I thought I had gone to heaven. The second time was with my husband and children who were 6 and 11yrs at the time and we loved the experience through the boy's eyesBut this time we took our 3 young grandchildren for 3 days, no parents!! We had a fabulous time! Now, we are from Australia, so this is a major holiday for everyone. Luckily our son and his wife came with the children to the USA and met us in LA ( we were travelling in the USA at the time).They then went and had a 4 night holiday on their own while we did Disneyland. I recommend this to all grandparents. It was such a special experience. So the details. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel for the location near the park.We did Disneyland one day, California Adventure the next and then back to Disneyland.I think we should have given ourselves more time and a relaxation day in between. The grandchildren are 3, 5 and 7 yrs and were still jet lagged when they were handed over to us!Everyone loved Disneyland the best.We used switch passes on all the big ticket rides that the two older kids wanted to ride on. This works extremely well!We watched the day parade from near a It's Small World, which was fantastic and easy to get a good spot.We returned to Disneyland on our last night to watch the fireworks.Unfortunately they were cancelled due to high winds but Disney put on a light and laser show instead. This was very good. We decided to take the kids for a walk through Disneyland at night to see all of the lights then decided to do a couple of farewell rides, the carousel and Dumbo.When we finished these there was a late night parade about to start.The park is getting quite at this time so there wasn't any problem getting front row positions. So if your children can stay up this late it's the best. We saw people at 3pm sitting in position to watch the night parade. We went back to the hotel, had dinner in downtown Disney and back to Disneyland and managed to see the last 10min of the parade when we arrived back in Disneyland. Seeing the whole parade an hour or so later was fabulous without any crowds!!!!All of our ride experiences, hotel and dining are reviewed separatelyA very special experience with our grandchildren!",Disneyland_California

There was a lot of people in Disneyland, so we used the Fast Pass system, and went on our favourite rides at the end of the evening before closing time without the long wait. We took advantage of the Disney Photopass. The photographers also took pictures with my Nikon, however, you might want to take a quick look at how they took your photo, in case you want a redo! With the heavy crowds, we made sure to plan out our day, packed plenty of snacks and water bottles, and ate at the restaurants before or after the dinner rush. Always check out the weather online, so you know what to wear in the park. Use the lockers if you can, so you don't have to pack too much with you, make sure to get one first thing in the morning.

Very dated, basic and run down, at a push 2* at most and I'm hardly fussy. Spoke to staff who said theyre all the same! Food plan was far to complicated. Breakfast was a joke, then hard to find somewhere to eat without reservations and no menus to pre plan and with a very fussy child it was impossible! Then the park. So over crowded it was a joke. All about generating revenue rather than an experience. Couldn't see the shows or attractions and ride waiting times of over 70minutes!! A place aimed at children how on earth do they see this as acceptable? My boys are good but like me anything over 30mins takes its toll. First day we achieved around 4 rides!! I know companies like to earn a profit but at the customers cost? I could understand if it was   20 a day but it's well over that!! We were all disappointed about the trip, the boys talk more about the ferry trip over than the holiday!! And to top it off, 4 emails later and still not even an acknowledgement!!

Outside of every restroom and restaurant you will find a clump of smokers, as well as anywhere you happen to walk. I realize that Europe is more comfortable with smoking everywherelet this happen? We would show a park employee a smoker and they would then walk right past without saying anything to him or her.At least half of the rides were closed for repairs or updates, and the restaurants kept running out of food, beer & ice cream! Disney calls their employees  cast members  and usually this is fitting based on the employees' energy levels & demeanor. Here, they should be called  employees . There was no excitement, no magic.

Take advantage of the Disney app to plan your queuing time and if possible use the fast pass options if you can. My only criticism was the very large number of rides and sections closed for refurbishment. 15 rides seemed to be a huge percent and it made the very high entrance fees seem a bit of a cheek. Make sure you stay for the fireworks and light show and the parades both during the day and at five are certainly worth the wait. We spent two days visiting both parks which seemed adaquate, albeit a large section was closed. I'm glad we waited for our kids to be older.

When we bought our tickets from the campsite we were staying in, we were not told of opening and closing times. This being summer we expected a late night for both parks. Come to find out (after waiting in long queues all day) that both parks closed early during the week and when we realized this it was already almost closing time for the other park, Walt Disney Studios park. The Disney park itself closed at 8pm and this was after opening at 10am! We had paid for park hopper tickets and were unable to use the other park. While we should have checked on times ourselves, we assumed that the times would be later than that, especially for summer. As our day progressed, we decided to eat at a fast food eaterie in Fantasyland   with the exchange rate   our hot dog, chicken nugget (gross beyond comparison) and half a roast chicken came to $100. Ouch! And it gets better. After the lunch I was going to take my daughter to the restroom   gag! I could smell the stench of urine before I even got inside. We managed to walk to another land and found one that didn't stink. We found out the reason, or part of the reason   Disney Paris doesn't do air conditioning   not even on the rides! We chose to ride on Pirates of the Caribbean next. We were corralled into one huge mass of people going down underground to get to the ride   no air conditioning at all! I nearly passed out and almost went out it was so bad. We finally get down to the water (and boats) to find that the employees had air conditioning near their work stations. We found the same to be true on the Peter Pan ride as well. Hotter than heck inside the whole ride and a cool blast of air as we got off where all the employees were standing. For the amount of money we spent (with exchange rate it was almost the same as buying tickets at Disneyland in Anaheim) we expected a bit more Disney magic. There were no characters (cardboard cutouts were on Main Street for pictures) and just more. Extremely disappointed and wouldn't bother going again. What a shame.",Disneyland_Paris

Expected but always felt like the park had reached capacity so any extra perk that comes with VIP status would be a welcome relief if this is a childhood bucket list tick for you.Far far far far to many stores selling Disney meant you were constantly thinking about the Shrek movie and its take on it.

Beside the fact that it almost feels like a knock off of Disney, with smaller versions of rides etc, all the shops are sponsored by brands you can buy at spinneys! You've got kinder and Ben&Jerry's and Hertz... and the whole thing is small, and has a taste of French attitude which kills the American spirit a little bit. Food options are horrible!

4529,357166370,1,2016-3,India,I had gone to Disneyland with my 4 year old daughter and my husband expecting it to be a wonderful experience! But it was a rather unpleasant one!The park had shut down some popular attractions without prior notice! The lion king show was called off even the grizzly gulch rides were off a few others weren't working as well!During character meet and greet we were asked to que up and we did but I saw a lot of people were breaking the line n getting in from under the rope! I told the staff there that they shouldn't let this happen but they did nothing abt it just kept saying oh no they have been in line! I was standing for almost 45 minutes in que and the line Infront of me was getting bigger than smaller and they say nobody broke the line! I even called mr Andy who was the rad there and told him but he was quite rude too found him arrogant as he was only speaking n hardly listening so I left without any pictures with my daughters fav characters!Also at the Hollywood hotel no characters came to meet kids as is expected out of a Disney property!they had no great activities for kids and the pool they had was also shut down!We felt rather silly booking that hotel because there was nothing to do!All in all a very bad experience and I don't think I will ever come to Disneyland again!,Disneyland_HongKong

We didn't go on any rides we just enjoyed the Cinemagique and the Parades, walked around and just savoured the view (We're not much of a rides person, anyway). It wasn't as busy as I expected it would be and we had good weather which was a plus! The fireworks at the end were amazing! We were sat at the front 30 minutes before the start of the show and it has to be one of the most magical things I have ever seen! The fireworks lasts for 20 minutes and each time it is different.

30953,549831732,5,2017-12,Netherlands,"I've never been to any of the american disney establishments, and I'm told Paris Disney isn't at all like them. That's quite ok with me. From what it felt like, Paris Disney was what the US parks used to be, not frenetic crowded mobbed over the top. So I quite enjoyed it, for its lack of excess. the park shows its age in spots, and when we were there it was a blistery cold windy day but we still had a good time, the line ups weren't so bad for all but the  hot ticket  rides. The staff were nicely costumed in what looked like comfortable cold weather gear that suited the style of the park.There's two parts, the  studio  part with a few rides, not much for the small kids, and then the larger older  euro disney  park ( if you look closely you'll spot some of the old branding around) and plenty of rides for the small fry. We'll definitely goi back, it IS a bit of a haul in from Paris though the Metro is well marked to get you there, the station on returning is less clear...( or we were tired and confused). Next visit we'll likely stay on site a couple of days to maximize the short hours and our kid's penchant for thrill rides of the flying elephant and spinning teacup rides.So if you're after a more laid back retro feel disney experience, this is the one. ( the one downside: the food court security guy was terribly snotty.) And we didn't see many smokers. So I have no idea where that's from.",Disneyland_Paris

Queues were not too bad, on average we were waiting about 30 minutes, our longest wait for the day was 45 mins for Star Tour. Space Mountain and Star Tour were absolutely mind blowing! The whole park was just a delight. We will definitely be back.",Disneyland_California
36373,273668985,5,2015-5,United Kingdom,"We have visited Alton Towers before, so only have that as a comparison but we found that for our youngest he often had to sit in the pram and miss out on a lot of the rides. This was not the case here at Eurodisney, luckily he was over 1.1m which meant that he got to experience all the rides, bar two, which was just brilliant for us a family. It meant that we experienced eurodisney together. We were there from Sunday to Thursday which was just about right.ProsThe food was a real suprise, we expected mediocre but it was better than that ! It was actually really good, ate in the blue lagoon, silver steakhouse, cafe mickey and buffalo bills If you eat in cafe mickey you can get to meet some of the characters , we met mickey, chip & dale and goofy. This was miles better than having to queue to meet each character in turnThe meal plans were a must, we had the plus option which was fantastic for breakfast & dinner. If you didn't have this it would work out ridiculously expensive. We knew we would start early and go back in the afternoons for a rest before venturing out again so took with us some stuff to make lunch with which saved us quite a lot. Also took a kettle and mugs as we knew there were no tea making facilities in the New York hotel.ConsWhen fast pass was working it worked well but ......they closed the fast pass system for many rides with no warning, still not sure why this was the case but it just added to the annoyance factor. If you are staying at the Disney hotels you can gain entry to the parks two hours before the general public but ......... There are only about 8 rides open at this time , one of them was supposed to be the Peter Pan ride which the kids were desperate to do, got up at 7am to be in the Park for 8am and this was one of the rides that decided not to actually open until 10.30 so the early system seemed a bit pointless......Despite some of the niggles we had a brilliant family time, we all really enjoyed it , the rides were lots of fun",Disneyland_Paris
35729,296673317,5,2015-8,United Kingdom,"We had a fantastic time. It is absolutely stunning. It is very clean and quite simply beautiful. So much attention to detail. The children (and Us) had a wonderful time. Firstly, the car park was straight forward with parking attendants at hand. Quite a walk to the park but no big deal. Even the entrance to the park is extremely grand and overwhelming. We were very grateful to the medical building that stored some medication for us on arrival as it needed to be put in a fridge. Very helpful  thank you. We found the queues for rides etc not too bad  what you would expect really and we never really queued beyond an hour. If you stay in a Disney hotel you get magical hours where you can enter at 8am rather than 10am. We found this incredibly useful as it meant we could park as close to the entrance as possible plus not so big queues for the characters who are there to greet you. Only downside is not all of the park is open so you can't get on some of those main rides early. Nevertheless you can ensure you are near the front of the queue when they do open. Yes, the food and shops are expensive but it is to be expected. The food places we did visit were fairly good. The staff are extremely friendly  everyone fantastic. We were a little bit disappointed with the princess pavilion but only because you have to book a time slot. Having booked a slot, we expected to then go through fairly quickly but there was still an hour queue? This made us unsure as to the reason for the ticketed time slot if you then have to queue anyway. However, I would imagine that there is a reason for this and that it is maybe one of the most popular places of the park. It wouldn't hurt to make people aware of this at booking though as it meant we were almost late for our booked Wild West show. For some reason I also thought we would meet more than one princess? We met Ariel who was fantastic with the children but my daughter would have loved to see a couple more. Our mistake. None of this detracted at all though from the wonderful time we had so I still say excellent! Finally the parade is out of this world. Actually felt myself get tearful. Sad I know. ",Disneyland_Paris

Since getting it in December, I have gone about ten times, so obviously my pass has paid for itself. If you have young children and live anywhere remotely close to here, an annual pass is an investment you should definitely consider. Of course, when going you need to be prepared for crowds, long wait times, children running around way ahead of their parents. If you can't handle any of these things, Disney is not the place for you. You can bring in your own food, so do that to avoid long food lines theme park prices. I normally bring sandwiches or something easy, and there are plenty of tables outside of the quick services places that you can sit and eat. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes :)!",Disneyland_California

The same rides, similar food, clean cut staff and spotless facilities.Unfortunately, August 17, we were very disappointed to find the exception, Disneylad Paris. Even at 10 am, when the park had just opened, the bathrooms looked and smelled disgusting. It appeared that the bathrooms had not been cleaned since the day before. The condition persisted through the day, at other bathrooms. It wa so bad that we chose to use the train station bathrooms instead!Unacceptable.",Disneyland_Paris
8710,132421265,5,2012-6,Malaysia,"Firstly, get a 2 day ticket! On the first day, watch all the shows, my kid's favorite was the 4D philmagic show ( check their showtimes and get a map!) if you have below 8 year old kids, the lines for their rides are longer in the mornings ( ie: fantasy land's Cinderella carousel, jumbo ride etc..). If you can, scheduled those in the evenings.Go to tomorrow land, adventure land and toy storyland in the mornings, because those are very full in the evenings( more than 30 minutes waiting time). Do catch the fantasy parade, best to be there early to get the best views :), also stay till night time for the spectacular fireworks!Get there early too to get good views. On the second day, take pictures will all of your favorite characters, the lines will be long and limited. If you did not manage to catch them, do ask the cast member character body guards, when they will appear next. Be ready and on time to avoid long queue. Next, go on the rides you missed in day 1 or go for seconds or thirds. June was particularly hot, the best ice creams were those near the  small world  attraction. Tips:1. Go to the park early, it formally opens at 10.30 but you can go in by 10 and queue up to take photos with mickey and minnie. 2. Security will check your bags for food and beverages; but you can bring mineral water bottles in. 3. For those looking for halal food, go to Tahitian terrace in Adventureland; it was just certified halal in April 2012. The food pretty good, esp the briyani , although a bit salty. 4. If planning to stay in the park morning night, get the 3in1 meal voucher at magic access customer service or at ticket counter. you save 20% on food and drinks for lunch, dinner and a snack.5. Please come early if you want to rent a stroller, the ques there seems never ending. 6. Do be prepared to guard your line, there will be some people trying to jump queue. 7. Skip the train ride, i forgot the name but it takes you around the park. it was super boring. But you can see many people queuing up for it. 8. You can refill your water bottle at certain washroom places. Found one near small world and toy story land. 9. The price of merchandise in the park is similar to the ones in the Disney Hotel and the airport. Only the park has more in variety. 10. Talk to the staff  cast members and ask for free Disney stickers :)My family and i loved this place very much! The staff here are very friendly and helpful. I hope the tips above will help you one way or another. To complete the Disney experience, try staying at the Disneyland hotel, your princess will love the   Make a princess  photography session, a bit pricey but worth it :). The Disney princesses also make several appearances in this hotel.And if you're visiting HK city and looking for halal food, try  Ziafat  1 min from MTR Tsim sha tshui exit near the mosque. Best briyani :) Halal food in Hong Kong is a bit pricey but taste good. Read in blogs that the French fries and fillet o fish in HK is fried using vegetable oil. Bring instant noodles, bread and brahim's to save some cost.",Disneyland_HongKong

There was about 3 coaches that went to Disney land. It was about a 45min drive by coach to get there. Very Scenic. You arrive at Disney land and you get stop at these big gates. Once you go through the gates there are multiple car parks. Its a bit of a walk in to the actually parks and you have to go through multiple gates to get in. Once you get in there are alot of shops gift shops and food shops. They have 3 different kinds of food shop, all you can eat buffet, fine dining and burgers and stuff.If you go in the rain you will find that most of the larger rides will be closed.

30429,581117608,2,2018-5,United Kingdom,"My boyfriend and I went to Disneyland Paris as a present for our twentieth birthdays, it was a present from my parents and they thought it would be nice me and my boyfriend go on holiday together for the first time.The last time I remember going to Disneyland was when I was around nine and all I could remember was that it was a magical place I wanted to go again. Between that time my family and I had been to Disney world in Florida twice, both had been amazing experiencing with excellent hotels, staff and food. I was very excited for this trip because it would truly be the first time abroad without my family but from the get go things seemed to go wrong, especially in the parks. The staff were overall rude. I speak little French, as does my boyfriend due to us obviously being English tourists. The first incident happened in a food court where we had just ordered some food and upon paying the staff what we had ordered, the person handling the money said something rather snarky in French. It appears he did not think we could understand him, either way we were not very impressed by his behaviour or the fact the French staff around him seemed to find his comment very amusing. The second incident happened later on in the trip when me and my boyfriend were deciding where we should eat, we decided on a buffet. We approached the front of one of the buffets to find no one there but when a staff member arrived they did not greet us or even smile, just stood there waiting for us to talk. I explained that we wanted to see the food that was on offer at the buffet. She explained only one of us could go and look, so I volenteered to go on. A few minutes before we had stopped at a food stand so i could grab an apple, i had been eating it while we stood waiting at the buffet and the staff member at the front desk of the buffet clearly saw i had one. Upon leaving the staff member wouldn't let me leave the premises and pointed to the apple, indicating that i had stolen it! 1. There were no apples available on this buffet. 2. If i stole it why would i openly eat it in front of everyone. 3. They had seen me take it in. Either way their behavior towards me was very rude and when i explained the situation that i had bought the apple in with me, they didn't seem all too impressed anyway.The third incident happened on the last day on our trip. We had bought fast track tickets for the mountain ride in Frontierland. We had been excited for this ride all day and we headed for the fast track queue where several other families and couples were waiting to have their tickets checked. Then out of the blue two young woman decide to push through the queue. Of course i stop them, no way was i having someone push in front of me, but even then they barged past me and other families with young children and certainly caused a scene while doing it. The staff member checking tickets did not do anything to sort out this situation. They simply looked at their tickets and let them through leaving me and of course several other people shocked that they hadn't said or done anything to these queue jumpers. Comparing this trip to Disneyland Paris and to my trip to Disneyworld, i can honestly say the people at Disney world are nicer and more welcoming while the ones at Paris acted like they did not even want to be there or help you. I think Disney needs to really consider who they employ and what training they are putting them through. I will not be visiting Disneyland Paris again, i would rather save my money for a trip where i do not feel like i am in a hostile environment. ",Disneyland_Paris

After four long years, we returned to the magical place where Mickey Mouse lives and everyone leaves their worries outside the front gate. I really enjoyed seeing Disneyland through the eyes of a child. Our son even noticed the hoof prints in the sidewalk in Frontierland. At 50 degrees, it was probably the coldest day we ever visited Disneyland; however, we did not let that slow us down for one minute. We were able to enjoy four rides and attractions as the crowds were the biggest I can remember. Highlight of the day was when my son looked up at me and smiled widely and said,  look Mommy, it's Mickey Mouse! This is the best day ever  as we stood along Main Street at the end of a fun filled afternoon and watched the parade.",Disneyland_California
35590,301461917,5,2015-8,United Kingdom,A must for big kids with small kids !!! lol. We took our two girls aged 11 and 8. Went on every ride during our four park days! Park Must do's... Crush roller coaster ( go backwards) and ratatouille was amazing too. Take water bottles and refil at water fountains.. save a fortune on drinks. . Took the super concentrated squash in our bags too. Use fast past first thing as most big rides stop by 11.30! Book tickets through Attractiontix if you are a uk resident. Saved over   100 on park tickets.Park don'ts... queue for the welcome to the princesses that is currently on. It's only anna and eilsa from frozen on a horse and carriage! Nothing else. Go to the Frozen sing along in the chaparral theatre instead.. even my husband was singing!,Disneyland_Paris
13472,458659057,5,2016-7,United Kingdom,"This was the first time I've been to Disney in such a long time and it was truly fantastic. The weather was so hot but it was still a great day. Would probably recommend a couple of days, we only did one day, but felt we were able to squeeze the main rides in.You can get fast passes for rides but they have time limits and limits on how often you can get them. I would recommend getting the Space Mountain one first   we didn't and it broke down temporarily and then the wait time stayed at over an hour for the rest of the day. Would also recommend doing Splash Mountain early in the day, as the time we got for it, it had to close unexpectedly and when we got to ride it, we got soaked and didn't properly dry for the rest of the day : The Star Wars ride was good   I'm not a big Star Wars fan but it was a good experience. Haunted Mansion   great Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters   more suited for kids, but it got my competitiveness going.Big Thunder Mountain   fast rollercoaster, loved it and screamed most of the way round!Mad Hatter Tea Party   everyone loves spinning cups Roger Rabbits Car Toon Spin   spinning cars, like a big kidFood   the food was mostly fast food and was very busy at meal times but we didn't find it a problem getting something to eat. The prices were a little expensive but we were on holiday and didn't want to carry things around with us.The night time parades run quite frequently   people start sitting and waiting at least 1 1.5 hours before to get a good spot, so make sure you get there early.Loved the parade, lots of lights, parade floats and great dancers.Transport wise, most people come by car. We were staying near Hollywood so we got an Uber to Disney. It took about an hour and cost about $60 each way. We felt this was reasonable.",Disneyland_California

Loved the setup, the beauty and the fun in all the different lands, Tomorrowland, Toystoryland, Fantasy land, Adventureland etc etc. The food tasted great, so much for the kids to enjoy, the parade and so many rides and experiences for adults to be part of. Tip   Have a detailed level understanding of the park layout before starting your day as a day is short for exploring whole of disneyland, and must utilise it very optimally. Start early and finish late.",Disneyland_HongKong
29379,642841276,4,2018-8,Canada,"Disneyland Paris still fall shorts of its US counterparts   however, it is moving in the right direction and I enjoyed my 2nd visit to this park much more than the previous one.What I liked: Different feel than the US parks, with some exclusive merchandising. Offpeak, you are able to cover quite a bit of ground (you could almost cover the 2 parks in one day). The night time  spectacular  is a mix of on castle projections and fireworks (more projections, less fireworks than Magic Kingdom). Many good line of sights to the night time spectacular. Mix of rides is good and the typical 7 8 years old kid should be able to experience pretty much any ride they desire. During peak times, food options are plentiful... although somewhat repetitive. Facilities (eg: washrooms, restaurants) are much better maintained, and clean than they were in the past (although some improvements in the maintenance area is still warranted).What to watch for could be improved: Customer service is a bit slow if you need help support. Too many temporary ride closures due to equipment breakdown. Quoted wait time is old fashioned and hit miss with the app not always up to date. Some WIFI is now available   but it is spotty at best. FastPass system needs to be upgraded to be more along the lines of what is being done in the US. Food options can become extremely limited after 7pm in some areas of the park. Character greetings (lines) are not as well structured   much more spontaneous and disorganized.All in, I like the improvements that have been made over the last few years and with Disney now in full control of the park, I am confident that the few areas in which it is still falling short will be improving over the next few years. I was there for the 20th anniversary celebrations as well as the 25th so maybe my next visit will be for the 30th!",Disneyland_Paris

We have done DLP in 2000 with our oldest, so that park had obviously increased in size. The park offered what we expected but we did not get the  Disney Magic  we get when we go to Walt Disney World in Florida. The food was OK but was expensive. The merchandise was also very expensive. As we had booked a Disney Hotel we took advantage of the extra magic hours. It seems they have half the park closed and only open some rides to half capacity so your extra magic hours are spent in line for about and hour at a time waitiing to get on the rides. I suppose the holiday was OK but next time we will certainly be keeping our money for Florida where you get mcuh more for your money.",Disneyland_Paris
29559,631351766,5,2018-11,United Kingdom,"I adore this place. It   s my happy place. So I am a tad bias. Best time to go is the week after Halloween. It   s not quite sorted for Christmas but you do get to see some Christmas stuff going up but you also get to see the Halloween stuff they haven   t taken down. Best of both worlds. But also the quietest time. Week before Halloween. Is the french school holidays it is rammed that week so best to avoid. If you are staying in a Disney hotel make use of the Disney magic hours. Only guests in the hotels can go into the parks before they open. Usual time is 10am. Hotel guests can go in at 8.30am. Not everything will be open but characters are around. Though if you have a photo pass the photographers are not out til 10 but cast member will take photos for you If you see the parade ( in November the parade was at 530pm but times vary so check when you are going) try to get by the castle for some lovely backdrop shoots of the castle and the parade. This can get busy so aim to find a space an hour before. And be aware people will push you get get their children in where they can. Stand your ground if you have been there a while. For a quieter spot the end of the parade down by city hall is the place for you however it is the last part of the parade so you will be waiting longer Once you have seen the parade the follow day my top is get in the rides when the parade is on. It   s a lot quieter less queues. Fireworks. This is the end of the day before the park closes. Again you need to be near the castle for this as there is a film projected onto the castle. But people will push and shove there way to the front and but their children on their shoulders right in front of you. So get in position early. The times vary on this so check when you are going. Fast pass. If you can use it. Scan you park ticket and come back at a time given. That way you can go see a character have something to eat etc before going back at the time given and walk straight on. PhotoPass. This is a great option if you are planning on getting character photos ride photos etc especially if you have a family. It   s    69. And you get three cards a main big one and two small so you can give to members of your family if you decide to split up in the park. All photos taken by the park photographers will be scan directly onto your card. You can then either have some printed there in the park. Which can be pricey or wait til you get home and download the app and print from your own computer. The photos stay on the app for one year. Food. Food can be expensive especially if you have a family. Take snacks with you. There   s water fountain around the park to fill up the bottles Like I said I love this place but it can get very busy be prepared to wait around in line for characters and rides. Wear comfortable shoes   do not wear new shoes stick with what you wear. Your feet will thank you afterwards . Be prepared to walk. Cos you will walk miles. I clocked up 22,000 steps around 9.2miles in just one day But most of all have fun. For some people it   s a once in a lifetime opportunity enjoy take it all in. Live it up. ",Disneyland_Paris

Disneyland takes you to other worlds, fun and adventure. That being said, while we went mid week and off season, the crowds were still discouraging. Believe me, it is no fun waiting 20 to 30 minutes for almost every ride  particularly when we tried to schedule our visit with supposedly lower crowds. It is hard getting through those crowds  and keeping in good spirits. (And why do people navigate with strollers like they do as madmen on the freeway?!?)

40285,148408968,3,missing,United Kingdom,"Just returned from Disneyland Paris on 30 th dec and it was very busy probably due to the fact that its the 20th anniversary. Although we did have a lovely time I feel the park cannot cope with the volume of people long queues for rides and food. What is even more annoying is being in a queue for 30mins only to be told that the ride has stopped for technical reasons. In the 3 days the rides we queued for that broke down were big thunder mountain railroad, cars, haunted mansion and buzz lightyear in the space of 3 days. Not great is it Disney. Also the fast pass system you can only do it one ride at a time. We got a fast pass for buzz lightyear so couldn't get another for Peter Pan till after our slotted time at 11.30. Buzz lightyear broke down we were in the queue for over 40 mins didn't get to ride it so decided to fast pass Peter Pan but there were none left. On a final note there is no alcohol allowed in the park even if you plan to leave your bag at left luggage. On our last day we entered the park with our luggage to take and leave at the left luggage. I had bought some wine to take home with me. They x rayed my baggage on the way in and told me I could not take alcohol in with me I explained the situation that I didn't plan to take the wine into the park I was leaving it at the left luggage but the guy insisted and said I could either leave with my wine or hand it over to him to put in the bin, so I had to say goodbye to my wine.

It's worth a few extra days so you can revisit your favourites over and over. Take time to notice all the fun things around, decor etc etc. The security now to get into these parks was great, after all who doesn' t want to be safe in this day and age . It was done in a friendly efficient manner, both at CA and DL entrances, although the main gate could do with a couple more metal detectors at peak times as all lines converged. Its great to stay within walking distance, can then just go back for a rest and refresh etc.  My iphone would not pick up wi fi so unfortunately could not get Max Pass, which meant running back and forth to get fast passes.

We arrived at 9:30 a.m. on a Saturday and were able to do the rides with no wait and met Minnie and Mickey with a short 5 minute wait each.Right after that we went to Princess Fantasy Faire where we waited for about an hour to meet 3 princesses (which princesses it will be varies).*In Disneyland we obtained Fast Passes where ever possible to avoid the long lines for the popular rides. *California Adventure has a neat feature that is not well advertised: it allows single riders the chance to move to the front of the line to fill any empty seats (groups of three). That worked very well for us as someone was always staying back with our toddler.*The crowds were much denser at Disneyland than at California Adventure where wait times for rides and attractions are much, much shorter. *The parade at California Adventure is based on Disney Pixar movies (The Incredibles, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, Toy Story etc.) a definite must for families with young children. We ate all of our 6 meals in Disneyland and were not disappointed with one meal or food item. There is an excellent variety of foods to choose from for all types of palates and Disney has a wide selection for those who are looking for healthier options. Each meal was ~ $30 for 2 adults and one child.Just outside of Disneyland and California Adventure is Downtown Disney: a really great shopping attraction that offers a wide assortment of stores, restaurants, and live entertainment.

It was hard on us who had to escort her pushing a wheelchair back and forth. The food, snacks and drinks still need improvement for the price that you have to pay. The fireworks show was spectacular!

We managed to go back to the main park to catch the lighting of the Christmas tree and the elaborate fireworks at the castle, though I think it's just a summary of the movie Frozen and the firework wasn't as spectacular as I expected.I do wish they provide heater so that visitors would have a more comfortable experience waiting and viewing the fireworks.",Disneyland_Paris

When you get photos taken at the park you are offered to purchase a digital copy that can be downloaded from Disneyphotopass.com.hk We purchased a bunch of digital downloads but didn't know that photos are available only for 2 weeks. our trip was longer than 2 weeks and when we returned home and tried to download the photos they were all deleted. Contacted Disneyphotopass and was told Tough Luck.In a previous trip, we paid for the same service from Universal Studios and Lego Land in Singapore, and the photos are still available for download (after nearly 5months).Disney would you please look into this? ... customer who pay for something and get nothing feel like they have been robbed.I Love Disney parks ... all of them ... They are the champions on entertainment.",Disneyland_HongKong

I personally liked Mystic Manor, Mickey's PhilharMagic. Tarzan's TreeHouse was a waste of time   its just a treehouse....with no interactive stuff. The Golden Mickeys was musical stage show with Disney Characters   kids will definitely love this. But best part are the two events at night: Disney Paint the Night Parade which starts at 7:45pm and ESPECIALLY the Disney in the Stars Fireworks at 9pm. Make sure you don't miss them both!!! The night parade were musical parade filled with dancers in colorful light costumes. The Fireworks were just incredible. I felt that these 2 events alone worth the admission. I don't mind paying full admission fee just for these 2 events! For dining, Avoid the Starlight Diner AT ALL COST!! its the one nearest the entrance into Tomorrowland from Main St USA. Main St Corner Caf   was much better. For transport, we stayed at Madera Hotel while we were there. We took the Jordan MTR (Red   Tsuen Wan Line) to change line at Lai King station into the Orange   Tung Chung Line. After that, all the way to Summer Bay station to get on the Disneyline line.

I wish there was as I had a buggy that was stolen. There are buggy parks and that is where my buggy was stolen. So either rent a Disney buggy at    12 for the day or buy a bicycle lock.

The one drawback would be that I wish Disney would let people know when there are certain events taking place. Apparently we went of 'Graduate's Night', so the park got more crowded as the day went on. This certainly would have affected our order of attraction, as the Matterhorn has no fast pass.

Firstly, DON'T buy a ticket for the park that day, then a ticket for this. You can get in at 4pm and stay till midnight most days and most of the rides are WALK ON, or a 5 minute wait. Also, don't bother buying halloween candy for trick or treaters back home, because you'll get about 30 pounds of it if you hit each of the trick or treat stations inside. Bring some plastic grocery bags to dump your candy into, the treat bags they give you don't come close to housing all the suger you will collect.Everyone was in costume, my husband was convinced that he would be the only fully grown male dressed up and he was very very wrong.

41619,122540983,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Myself and my partner visited Disneyland on a weekend trip to Paris in October 2011 :) this was a last minute thing... We hopped on a train from Gare Du Nord which took approximately 40 minutes. We decided we wanted entrance to the main park and Universal Studios which was 75E each! Pretty good really :) (you can get it cheaper if you book in advance online and they send you the ticket). The cashier told us that the Universal Studios closed at 7.30pm so we had plenty of time to see and do everything. First I'll start with the main park....There are 3 sections... we spent most of our time in one section, going on all of the rides and eating in a nice cafe, etc. There are some good (and some scary :) ) rides there.. (it is the left section on the map). The Haunted House was good and so were the rides next to it (cant remember the names, sorry   one looks like a volcano, that was a scary ride haha).There was a show in the centre, by the pink princess castle, which was quite good :) it was the evil characters in the shows. Then we went to Universal Studios and went on the rides there... they were awesome! We went on the Hollywood Tower (took me a lot of pursuading my boyfriend to come on that with me lol) which is like a lift that goes crazy, dropping and all   this took over an hour to queue for but well worth it :) We also went on Space Mountain   this was AWESOME!!!! Highly recommended! So fun and didnt have to queue as it was about to close!We went on some of the other rides here too which were fab, but cant remember names, sorry. We also went on the tour... this is a cart thing that takes you round a 'Hollywood set'   so realistic. And they do some special effects aswell. This was incredible! Overall, Disneyland Paris is well worth the visit and well worth the money! I cant recommend this place highly enough... I want to go back! :)",Disneyland_Paris

The place itself is quite small. I know it is low season but a lot of the restaurants were closed also which meant massive queues to even get a cup of coffee. My boyfriend queued for about 20 minutes for two drinks. (We were desperate as we were so cold!!)

If you aren't bothered about going on the rides with your friends partner then get a single rider ticket. Food wasn't overpriced. You can take water into the park and there are plenty of water fountains to fill up at. Parades were excellent however we didn't get to see the fireworks as there was a technical problem.

It is such an awesome escape from the frantic, sometimes    dirty    city life that surrounds it. All the normal Disney characters can be seen plus a number of new (to Disney)    Marvel    characters and Marvel inspired rides. Favourites of our family include the Jungle River Cruise, Grizzly Gulch, It   s a Small World, TeaCup ride, Slinky Dog and Mystic Manor. The staff are almost always friendly and helpful and the shows and parades are ALWAYS jaw dropping and definitely not to be missed. Watch out for the sporadic street performances of the street sweeper drummers who have an amazing drum perscusion show based on their garbage bins and cleaning implements. Also watch out for the    cleaner    who paints (using water) Disney characters literally on the street road. There are only really two possible negatives to the Disney experience. A very limited selection of western style (and quality) foods in some of the Disney resteraunts. Lastly, if it   s a mainland China holiday Disney can be quite unpleasant with the crowds. The best plan is to ALWAYS try and get there for opening time for less queues and crowds. Having said that, the iconic fireworks show is well worth hanging around for. Oh, and get there by train. Disney has its own train station. It   s the cleanest, quickest, cheapest way to get there. Have a GREAT trip to Disneyland. I thoroughly recommend it.",Disneyland_HongKong

The first time we visited, years ago, we got ourselves a map and systematically ticked off every ride and every show. In two days we had done the lot. Now, after 2 days, we'd not even achieved half of that. The magical hour is nothing like what it was. We spent half of it queuing to get in. I can't believe on their 60th anniversary, they are issuing tickets and taking security photos at the turnstile! Unbelievable. You used to do all the ticketing aspect at the ticket booth and the turnstile was a quick entrance into the park. There were rides closed for maintenance, the monorail, the Disney Train, Matterhorn and Steamboat which we were forewarned about on the app, but then several rides kept closing due to power issues   those being Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted House, Space Mountain. This meant a lot of people looking for something else to do, putting pressure on the other rides. That said, would we come back? Probably. We would give it a second chance in the hope that things have improved. Please just be prepared for a lot of long queues. Make the most of the fast passes (which ran out just after lunch).

And finally on my last day I found my favourite shop Pandora in a little corner of the park where thery sell Disney Charms (which you can't get over here).Great place to take the young or old and you all walk away smiling.",Disneyland_California
42547,6562259,2,missing,United Kingdom,"We recently booked a surprise trip for our children  aged 11 & 14. Disneyland itself was lovely & magical however it was very over subscribed. We queued most of the day. The rides and experiences were good  however there are some major issues. The staff are rude and unhelpful. The cafe areas were unclean and we didnt once sit down to a table which had been cleared. There were no maps in English as they had run out. The food and merchandise is horrifically priced and for the food, of poor quality & a healthy option is nowhere to be seen. It snowed once for 2 minutes  its supposed to snow all the time & the characters are available for the kids on sparse occasions about 40 kids deep so a photo and cuddle is out of the question. All in all, a nice day but the magical experience can only be created by yourselves as the staff arent interested.Universal studios was dire  over priced and dull. It takes about 2 hours to do the whole park. We complained and asked if we could go in the other park again  of course...if you pay again!Again, rude staff, poor quality food, unclean and overpriced merchandise.The Disney Village  open to all with restaurants etc was ok. We had our New Years Eve meal here  it was   65 per head but the only meal worth eating whilst we were there. We were sold a wild west show  turned out to be salsa  and had to wait 30 minutes in the rain to get in & another 30 minutes on some back stairs waiting to be seated but food was nice.Overall  don't bother with Paris. We spent   2000 on the trip, taxis and food for 4 of us for 4 days...save your money & go to Florida & enjoy the magic.",Disneyland_Paris

Miserable, bolshy staff, rip off prices and what I would describe as a hatred for English people, this was the worst experience we have had in France ever!!! The staff understand English perfectly well if euros are mentioned or required, but should you raise a concern or complaint, forget it, total lack of customer service, ignorance and rudeness you will never experience anywhere else...... shame really because if they adopted the same mentality as their colleagues in the states then it would be a more pleasurable experience.

26958,127312106,4,2012-3,United States,"My husband, 2 kids (8 and 5) and I visited Disneyland during the first week of March. I had not been since I was a teen. I grew up in L.A. so we visited Disneyland a lot when I was a child. It has certainly changed, mainly due to the massive crowd, and the proliferation of annual passholders, some of which are rather riff raff y. We had hoped crowds would be smaller due to the timing of our visit, but I am thinking there really is no day you can really get away from them. I think I got spoiled because I went to Disneyworld in November about 10 years ago on my honeymoon and we had the whole parks to ourselves and it was AMAZING. Weather was fairly cooperative though chilly in the morning, and warm in the afternoon so layers are a must. One thing I give TEN stars to is the service we received at the park. Well done, Disneyland! You have incredible employees who are just all so very nice and attentive. My daughter had a birthday button on and so many people wished her a happy birthday, many of them saying her name too. Even other people enjoying the park gave bday wishes! Most people were in good spirits. It's hard to be down at Disneyland! I can see where if I were an annual passholder having a bad day, I'd just head to Disneyland to feel better! That said, there were some rather unsavory looking people there, with little boys with earrings and gold chains and people looking a bit ghetto. There was no shortage of  princess  daughters decked out in what looked to be very uncomfortable dresses and shoes for a day at a theme park.I had to feel sorry for some of them in those scratchy dresses all day. Some of the parents were a bit rude at times. I'm not a bigot or anything like that. It just seemed half the people there were locals which kind of dampened the spirit somehow. I think Disney sells the annual passes a little too cheap. As for rides, we were fine with the wait times for the most part. Some rides were not really worth the wait. Some, like Indiana Jones, were. We all loved Pirates of the Carribbean, a childhood fave of mine, which really never had a line as it moves so fast with all the boats they have, so we went on that one 3 or 4 times a day. I remember as a child in the 70s eating at the Blue Bayou a lot. We were not wealthy by any means. Now it seems like a lot of trouble to get in there, and way overpriced. So I will have to rely on my memory of the Mint Juleps I so loved. We found food overpriced and unmemorable throughout, but we were pleasantly surprised at the Mexican sit down place, I do forget the name. You pick up the food yourself and sit down, the atmosphere is quite nice, outdoor seating, nice food. Otherwise, think about bringing your own. We spent $40 at this Mexican place (it was in Frontierland), and $25 another time on 4 hot dogs and chips, so the Mexican cafe was a much better value. Dole Whips were fine, don't understand the hype.My kids went into catatonia trying to decide on souvenirs. We ended up buying them from Downtown Disney on the last day so we didn't have to lug anything around, though we did bring a backpack full of sweaters, a water bottle which we refilled in the park several times, and some snacks. Still, you will want a hot meal at some point and I do recommend the above mentioned place. Back to the rides, we were fortunate enough to have use of a Magic Morning pass which lets you into the park at 9 am instead of 10 am. During that hour of less crowds, we managed to get on Space Mountain (too intense for my kids btw), Autopia, and Star Tours. Star Tours is definitely worth doing. If you don't have a Magic Morning, you should do the Fast Pass on these rides because they lines are sometimes 60 minutes, even in early March.Autopia was not really worth the long wait. My leg sure did get tired driving that little car around, but it was cute especially if you don't have to wait long. We waited 20 min even during Magic Morning. Small World had a long line at one point and no line about an hour later, so wait a bit after park opening to go on that one. The line died to down to almost nothing about 1 2 hours after open. Also, we hit the railroad ride in Frontierland right after they dropped the rope at 10 am, and didn't have to wait at all.We loved Splash Mountain but the line does get long. Our fave rides for the whole family were Pirates, Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain Railroad, Space Mountain, and Star Tours. My 5 yr old did not appreciate some of these rides, however, we managed to talk her onto all of them anyway lol. The rides for smaller children were somewhat lackluster, according to my 8 yr old, but we all liked the Roger Rabbit ride a lot even though the line is surprisingly long! You don't know it until you are fully into it, but it goes on and on and on lol. Peter Pan's flight was really short for the long wait. However, I always enjoy them anyway, and sitting down for a ride in a cool, airy place is always a welcome reprieve from walking and standing. Just wish some of the rides were longer! Overall, we enjoyed Disneyland a lot but we will go back in November or February next time to get the most bang for our (huge amount of ) bucks. Also, I felt Disneyworld parks are bigger and more spacious so we will be going there next time. RIP Disneyland of my youth.

35651,299219046,5,2015-8,United Kingdom,"My Fianc   and I had a great time at Disney, I had been before but it was my Fianc  's first time at Disneyland Paris. The park was PACKED but we managed to go on nearly all the rides by using the free fast pass system and downloading the wait time app. We stayed in a hotel in Gare Du Nord and travelled in for the day. This was an easy and convenient way to get to Disneyland without paying Disney hotel prices! Although the park was busy we were able to do many rides by planning which rides we would do in advance, this is easy for older guests (we are 24 and 25) but couples with small children may find this difficult. As a good tip I would use fast pass as this enables you to go back to a ride and skip the queue at a set time although you can only have one fast pass ticket at a time so make sure you don't get a late slot as you won't be able to get a sooner one even in a different park. You can get into the Studios early (before 10am) and queue up for the rides   this also helps with the length of the queue. Guests who are not staying in the parks can only get into the main Disneyland Park after magic hours (a privilege for only Disney Hotel Guests). If you do arrive early and can't get in I would advise going to the Disney village and having a look at the shops, although some don't open till 9am. The McDonald's in the Disney Village was very quiet and offered free and fast WIFI.This is a great park and offers a range of shops, it also has a good range of Disney trading pins in many locations.Well worth a visit but buy your ticket before you go to save both money and time lining up in the morning.",Disneyland_Paris

There were a lot of characters doing scheduled meet and greets so there were plenty of opportunities of getting autographs and photos. Unfortunately there were not as many professional photographers at meet and greets as there had been on previous visits which is a shame. The only problem I have with Disneyland Park is the smoking!

All the older rides I still remember were there, from Snow White to the Matterhorn, with just a few changes. To make the most out of your visit, learn how to use the fast pass. We had no idea it was a free service until just before our last day in the park, and we also learned that not all rides use it. Splash Mountain does use the fast pass, however it does not let you choose a time to go on it, it spits out a chosen time for you. The Matterhorn is one of those that does not use it, and always has a steady line, but the added effects are fantastic. We did not find the submarine ride or the autotopia rides worth the wait.

Disgruntled. Not friendly. Of course the  Disney  people that work there were overly smiley and such, but the rest were not fun. The worst was my wife and I broke down for corn dogs and we found a table across from the First Aid area. We sat there for an hour and I said we aren't moving until one Disney cast member smiles. Well after an hour I had to get moving, but not one time did someone smile. This was an exit area for cast members, so it was a steady stream of people.

35330,309929225,3,2015-9,United Kingdom,"My husband and I travelled to Euro Disney (as they called it then back in 2006'.Compared to back in 2006 it seems to have gone a little downhill sadly ... Or maybe we were spoilt with a trip to Florida in 2007 who knows.We decided to travel to Disneyland Paris as it was closest, easiest and cheapest for our two children (2 years and 6 years). We stayed at the Kyriad hotel which suited nicely as it wasn't too far away and offered free shuttles to and from Disney each day.Upon arriving at Disneyland (which was a complete surprise for our children) it was sadly pouring with rain. Being English we are used to the odd downpour but we did fancy a Poncho and so we queued for almost 30 minutes at a small booth for a poncho for us and the kids . We found the ques appalling! People were shoving and shouting and quite frankly my husband looked totally bewildered by the idea of having to push and shove for a bit of plastic and he is too polite to push and be rude, thus it took us a long time to buy said poncho and the staff seemed far from happy with the situation. Luckily the weather improved throughout the day and so we were able to get dry again later. My son was happy to be at Disney , he was surprised but I don't think it was what he thought it would be ...  Firstly , he couldn't understand why on earth a queue would be almost an hour long for a ride which only lasts up to two minutes. I agreed and we soon figured out the fast pass route followed by the baby switch facility which is simply fab ! We managed about four rides on our first day as it was so busy but we got into the swing of things further along in the week.By day two we were starting to beats he queues with fast pass and baby switch and we had figured out to shop at a local supermarket to beat the prices. Top tip for anyone, especially families with kids is to make picnics as the prices in Disney as extortionate !!! We ate each day at one of the picnic locations near to a park. The kids loved the park (pochahontas themed park). However, we continued to be bombarded by wasps and unfortunately on my second day I was stung twice by a wasp , this sent my son into a panic every time a wasp so much as flew by... And they are everywhere in Disney it's a serious problem which seriously needs addressing.Things have really changed in terms of money, you can see this as whilst we greatly enjoyed watching the late night fireworks and light show ,it wasn't what it was when we first saw it many years ago. The fireworks are only very few in comparison to what we have seen in the past and they now rely up water and lights to create a show which I suppose was better for my son as he hates loud bangs. Personally though , the more fireworks the better for me. Saying that ,my daughter hated being in the dark so sadly we spent our time trying to watch said show whilst consoling our two year old and holding out six year olds ears incase of a sudden bang (which there aren't any for any parents with children who suffer with noise issues). Another big difference is the parades, when we first went parades were twice a day followed by the huge parade at night time prior to the fireworks... Now there is one parade a day and in between this they do a mini parade which includes a horse and cart with the frozen princesses in which lasts about ten minutes.... My daughter loved this as she developed a deep love for Anna whilst there.Frozen was certainly the theme of Disney obviously as its a hit film and the kids all love it (including me and I'm 32!). We had the pleasure of watching the frozen singalong which is well worth queuing for, it is magical as I took the time to record it on my iPhone, my daughter now spends at least twenty minutes each day since watching it ... Over and over ... And over and over .... She still waves to Anna even now from our kitchen table whilst having her snack.The shops!!! I love shops but my god there are loads and they all sell pretty much the same, it never used to be like that. Once upon a time each shop seemed to sell different merchandise which meant that you were more inclined to go into each one ... Now it is literally the same in every shop apart from the Christmas shop which was divine. We ended up spending an absolute fortune on merchandise as we are huge Disney fans. Upon returning home I sadly found that much of it was available on the disneystore for less than the park price :( At least our stuff is labelled with  Disney parks   but still, it doesn't seem fair that it's more expensive there than online ... So my tip would be to purchase your Anna, Elsa, Olaf or whatever else and take them with you to save tears from either your child or your wallet.My favourite shop is still the main one (emporium) but try to go early in the afternoon to avoid the hustle and bustle. The rides were fab but we're disappointed to find its a small world was shut until December. The kids enjoyed the rides and those that they couldn't ride were still accessible to my husband and I thanks to the baby switch facility. My only issue with the rides involves Thunder Mountain which seemed to break down at least twice a day (this happened all week ). My son and I had the pleasure of being the first back onto the ride following a closure and whilst he enjoyed it , I was slightly worried we would be one of the poor people climbing off on the ramp if it got stuck again (luckily it didn't). This needs fixing Disney if you're reading !!!I love Disney and I love the whole experience of visiting their parks but something was missing this time ... The magic ? I'm not sure .... It was sooo overcrowded and busy, I found that every time I needed the loo I was faced with a ten  twenty minute queue in the ladies whereas my husband went straight in and out. Perhaps more toilets for women with kids are required ?? Queues for food and toilets were awkward as who wants to wait for essentials with young kids ?!I think all the advertising of  now you can say yes   is because it can be achieved for cheaper these days with deals I guess and so now the park is packed to the rafters... This takes the magic away as it becomes crowded and uncomfy.We visited for five days using a five for four ticket from attraction tix (great value for tickets if your interested). We did have fun and the kids have memories to last a life time as we made it magical in our own way. I just hope Disney reads this and realise they need to reinstall some of their magic into their park. ",Disneyland_Paris

Esp if you want to see shows and parade. (Which were both epic!)Queues are worth it, fast pass to return at certain time on lots of rides. Those without, get there first in the morning. You do need 4days I'd say to get the most out of everythingFood is expensive, picnics not allowed in park. But you can take snacks.Our favourite place to eat was the hakuna matata near Indiana Jones ride. It's cheap and different from the usual burger or pizza everywhere else.Souvineers are everywhere and you'll want them all. But again, not cheap. You'll need about 150 a day for family of 4 for food, snacks and a few momentos. I'mLucky to have boys so no need for princess dresses haha! Star Wars merchandise is fab for boys. There's Jedi training they can take part in (girls too of course) and show in Hyperion cafe, which sells themed burgers, but beware that gets crazy busy.

Also special spots for parade (near its a small world is best imo) staff all so friendly. You may come home exhausted and penniless, but the memories will last forever. ",Disneyland_Paris

13810,445063995,5,2016-12,United States,"Such an amazing place. Some tips... if you don't care for crowds, go to the park when it opens, it can get very crowded between lunch and dinner time. One thing we noticed, the vast majority of the crowd was polite and considerate of others, even when the park seemed at capacity. Most of the restaurants that took reservations were fully booked by the time we got there, so make reservations if you want to have a better eating experience. Last, but not least...wear comfortable shoes.As for Disneyland. I'm so thankful this magical place exists. It's still the best place to take children old enough to be familiar with the Disney movies. It's my opinion that there is no place (that I've been to) that has been able to carry our imagination so fully. It's clean, mostly organized, and filled with entertainment options as well. As adults, we couldn't ask for more. The only disappointment was in the food. Flavors, textures, and even food temperature was off. Maybe I have expectations that they would invest in excellent chefs to live up to the level of their franchise class   instead, time and time again over our 3 day stay, we were disappointed.That being said, we had the time of our lives soaking it all up. The highlight was the iconic castle transformed into an ice castle via lights and decor   breathtaking to see on person. See it at night too!We hope Disneyland remains open for many, many generations to come.Thank you Walt Disney for making your dream a reality shared with us all!",Disneyland_California

Having been a huge Disney fan all of my life I was really excited to visit the Original park.All bar 1 queue was 5 mins or less. The park was spotless and as always cast members proved why Disney rules in the hospitality and entertainment industry.We ate at the plaza which was great food.Yes it's pricey but worth every penny for the experience you get for your money.It's not a case of if I'm going back but when! ,Disneyland_California

The staff has always gone out of their way to help in any situation...and without giving you the feeling that they're trying to rush things, or get you out of their hair. Unusual and commendable. Admission prices are a bit pricey, and food lines can get a bit crowded, but nothing really out of line considering the number of people. My one dislike is the  Fast Pass  situation, where you're waiting in line for an attraction, and the fast pass holders just whiz right by and get ahead of everyone. While they do limit the number of fast passers who can take the seats, it really delays things for us, the  vast unwashed  who don't mind waiting our turn.",Disneyland_California

The list continues on and onI'm a SoCal girl and Disney has always been a place that my family and I have enjoyed since I was an infant.

I still feel the same now that I have a daughter of my own. I love going to the Happiest Place on Earth where it's carefree and to escape for even just an hour and share that with her.

So many things to do, there really is something for everyone. Tips for if your new to Disneyland (or California Adventures)1. Familiarize yourself with a fastpass and how it works2. If you have a smartphone consider downloading a wait time app (My favorite free on is Mousewait)3. Also, if you have a smartphone bring an extra charger4. Bring water and snacks for when you're in line5. If you want to watch a parade, show or fireworks, give yourself plenty of time to get a good spot6. Look online at food options so you don't spend time in the park doing so (I recommend going to http:  allears.net)7. Bring a camera to capture all your fun mememories!",Disneyland_California
38590,194616781,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Here are a few tips that we put together for the park and have amended for this visit having now been three times.   We have been twice before in May and February and were surprised that the park was so much busier in February than May and it wasn   t a French holiday. Weekdays were quiet and certainly worth blitzing the rides that have long queues.   Tip for some rides     if your children are young and happy to dress up then the whole family can use Thunder Mountain via the Fastpass line as many times as they want if they are dressed as cowboys (or Jess from Toy Story). The same applies if you dress as Buzz for the Buzz Lightyear ride. Both of these had big queues during the day.    The    Baby Switch    system works well. You don   t have to have a baby but a child that doesn   t want to go on a ride. As you go through the gates ask the attendant for a baby switch voucher and they give you a piece of paper that allows your partner to then jump to the front of the queue with up to 2 children (depending on the ride e.g. Thunder Mountain allows 3 in a row so you can take three children but Crushers Coaster will only allow 1 with you). This is done well and you don   t feel awkward. There is no time limit on these so every ride we got one of these and then used them during the day if there were any queues or if the fast pass system didn   t apply to a ride. I think it would even be possible to do without a child but I   m not advocating this!!!    We have found that as time has gone on they have become a little more attentive to this system to ensure that it works fairly.These were the top tips that my wife wrote down for us to take into the park:   FASTPASS RIDES     on busy days these run out quickly and they close the fast pass machines down around lunchtime. They also don   t open them at all on some rides e.g. Indiana Jones     we asked them about this and they said that it depends on the foot count through the front door. If it   s busy at all then they don   t run it at all on this ride!   Indiana Jones, Temple of Peril  Adventureland height 1.4m   Space Mountain Mission 2  Discoveryland 1.32m   Buzz lightyear Laser blast  Discoveryland    Star tours  Discoveryland 1.02m   Big thunder mountain  Frontierland 1.02m   Peter Pans flight  Fantasyland   Rock and Roll Coaster  Studios Backlot 1.2m   The twilight zone Tower terror  Studios Production Courtyard 1.02m   Flying carpets over Agrobah  Studios Toon studio   Popular rides with no fast pass:   Crush Coaster Studios 1.07m     the only way to do this ride is to get in first thing in the morning. The Studios doors open at 9:30am     head straight to this ride and it will be the shortest queue of the whole day. We never saw the wait time on this ride to be less than 60 minutes.   RC Racer Studios 1.2m   Autopia Discovery land 1.32 self drive   It   s a small world  Fantasy land (long queue but moves quickly)   Pirates of caribean  Adventure land (long queue but moves quickly, beware younger children  get wet and drop)   Other helpful hints   Always very long queue to see The Princesses near it   s a Small World go early. The wait time is frequently 2 hours.   Captain EO   waste of time   Fastpass after 2 hours from previous one issued   or after the earliest time that your current Fastpass is valid from.   Magic hours 8 10am:   Space Mountain Discovery land   Buzz lightyear Discovery land   Peter Pan Fantasy land   Dumbo Fantasy land   Madhatter tea cups Fantasy land   Le Carrousel Fantasy land   Character Hunting     my kids loved getting autographs and photos. When it is busy you need to plan this well and find out on the information sheets where they are going to be. A fantastic place to get some unusual characters at the weekend is out side the Lilo and Stitch show at 11:00 am and 12:00pm outside the main studio block. Here we found Lilo, Stitch, Ratatouille characters, Buzz characters, Cruella de Ville, princesses etc etc. This year they have improved this process with ordered queues and staff indicating the end of the queue so that you don   t wait and then the character walks off. The next best place is at the end of the procession that happens several times a day. The train stops outside the castle and then all of the characters go to fixed place each day. We worked out where Donald and Daisey went and got photos with both of them within a few minutes.The next bit is only for the sad ones who want to get a good score on Buzz Lightyear! The targets score different points (Circle   100, Square   500, Diamond   5,000, Triangle   10,000). There are some added, hidden targets as well. On Zurg on his upper chest in the midline is a target that gets you 50,000 points. There are also some targets in the dark tunnel on the roof that score very highly. There are others including the mystery Mickey Mouse target but I won   t spoil it for all! So stick to diamonds and triangles and look for the hidden targets. Make the most with a breakdown and reboot of the system as you can score vast amounts!",Disneyland_Paris
33360,409444116,3,2016-8,Poland,"I was very excited to visit both Disney parks: Main one and Disney Studios.I bought 2 days 2 parks ticket to see all the attractions and I was disapointed. I can compare it to Disneyland at Tokyo that I visited and I loved it. The european park is overrated  it needs to be renovated. Most of the rides seems broken, have scraches and broken elements. If this you are planning your first disney experiance.In general, if it's ok with your budget I advise you to save a little bit longer and have a nice holidays at USA Disneylands. The Paris one is nice, but disappointing. Because of its condition it doesn't have any magic in it.On my first day I went to Disney Studios. The park is so, so, more simple and less fairy than the main one. You need less than one day to visit and ride all the attractions  I was there at opening hours (10:00) and after 16:00 I've seen all. The rides are not so entertaining as at the Disney Parks in California or Tokyo. They lasts short and are less interactive  they are, for me overdated. It happened to me at least 4 times, that the ride got broken during riding. It was fixed but it was not so fun. What I recommend if you are 20  is: nemo ride ( Crush's Coaster  )  super speed plus suddenly drops, Twilight Zone of Terror Tower  no lines to wait. Don't miss the Show Mickey and the Magician  it's at the toon studio  super entertaining, 30 mini musical with mickey and the classic disney characters. I'm 23 and I loved it! I also loved Ratatouille: The Adventure. It's a very moder and fun ride, worth waiting. The food at Disney studio is nice, you get a big portions at every food point but it's quite expensive  16 euro per one hamburger set. I recommend to avoid popular lunch time and hit the most popular rides at that time. Also, remember to use disney fast pass to avoid waiting. You can get it at special points next to a ride. You can get one admission per one ticket  you scan it every 2 3h. The main park is very crowded and when I visited it (July 2016) I was in construction in many areas  one  land  had only one ride working! The rest is ok, it's not so  OMG  as the japanesee park was ( it's much more modern, like the ones in the USA). I was not charmed at all ( altho I tried my best...). Again, the food was expensive but nice. The lines you were supposed to wait we're just killing me  it took ages to get to popular ride (at least 60 min waiting) and rides itself were  used out  and in bad condition. It was not bad, but it was not that  disney magic  would you expect. I had a geat first impression at Disneyland Tokyo so I felt that I wasted my money on the Paris one. If you are still planning to visit it I recommend you to: Plan the tripThe park is big so you need to plan how to spend your time. I managed to see all in 2 days, but some of the rides were closed  visit Disneyland Paris site, see the rides and plan what you want to see the most, also try to goolge how it looks  I for instance was very into special effects ride at Disney Studio but it was so,so and I lost a lot of time on it. Download the official app. You will get the map of rides, restaurants and shops plus info how long you will have to wait to a ride. It helps a LOT when planning what to see first. WATCH OUT, there is no free wi fi at the park! Use your Fast Pass wiseChoose the coolest rides and get a fast pass for them to avoid 2h of waiting. My advise:Disney Studio:Crush's Coaster  Ratatouille: The AdventureRC RacerDisneyland Paris:Buzz Lightyear Laser BlastPeter Pan's FlightSpace Mountain  : Mission 2Star Tours  Try not to bring backpacks, big bags, umbrellas. It will be hard to keep them close to you on any ride. Visit the shops. They are nice and most of them have different marchendise to buy Look closer and be curious. I found an amazing ice cream spot and nice small food trucks, it's easy to miss cool places on the main street.",Disneyland_Paris

28847,8091624,4,missing,United States,"We've been to both CA Adventure (less crowded, clean, adult friendly & comfortable) and Disneyland (obnoxiously crowded and less magic). One visit, we just went to CA Adventure. There is not that much to see here and you could see everything in 1 2 day, if you go on a quiet day (Mon   Wed) with no crowds and really enjoy yourself. They now have an electric parade (which was not there when we visited last) so it appears that they are trying to do more things for this park and it does have a great look and feel to it. It's beautiful and picturesque.Then there is Disneyland. Unfortunately, we went on a very hot day and didn't get into the park until after 10:30am. Big mistake! Be there by 9:00am and get on the rides you want to see ASAP! Go for the sub ride because after 10   the lines get too long and it's not worth all that. We did not see this ride because of that.Bring water and a hat, we were dehydrated in no time and had a sun headache. Lack of poor planning on our part. The sun hit us hard within 2 hours (1:00pm) we were dehydrated and cranky. So we left. The lines get even LONGER after noon.Stay close to the park and leave between 1:00 4:00pm to refresh and eat. Felt that the food was overpriced for what you get but even the restaurants directly outside the park are overpriced, so be careful. We ended up spending $40 in an IHOP so be careful.Don't visit on holiday weeks. If you do   get there early, leave the crowds and heat around 1. Return around 5ish when the sun is going down, things cools off and people get off lines to eat dinner or leave. Go on rides during the parade (only if you've seen the parade, it's really fantastic!)We found all of CA to be very nice but Disneyland was a misrepresentation. It appears a lot of the LA crowd does not like tourists and can be quite rude. CA, to us, tends to be one of the friendliest states to visit but only if you avoid the LA area ;o) ha sorry, folks but the fact remains   most are obnoxious drivers and they drive their strollers, like they're cars ;o) The crowd control in Disney could be improved greatly and make a nice Disney experience. Unfortunately, they need to keep this LITTLE park  less accessible  for the safety of all paying customers.On a nice note   We truly enjoyed their parade and their fireworks display. This made it worth the cost. We would return, but only on a less crowded week. Put a limit on entrance on busy weeks for safety and comfort reasons. Disney, listen up for safety reasons!

This vacation was great in a sense as it provided us a mini getaway from our regular living quarters and for reminiscing good times however in comparison i   d pick Disney World in FL if the price was more reasonable affordable for people from Canada visiting there. The weather was great during the day and a bit windier at night, no fireworks (just the light show at night with Disney remixes) which was a tad disappointing.

31447,520661601,5,2017-8,United Kingdom,"Went there 31st August 2017 for many reasons and 1 of them being, it was the cheapest day. I went with a mate n her child and I'm quite a big kid myself so I really enjoyed it. We went for one day literally caught a flight in the morning from London Gatwick and flew back home in the evening. Saved A LOT of money by doing this. Timed it very wisely to the parks opening hours so we had enough time to enjoy ourselves. Spent exactly   93.28 on return flight but would have cost   15 cheaper if I booked it when I first saw it. Now the flight were cheaper because it 'end of summer...back to school week' which also meant that the park would not be as packed and busy which was very true once we got there. Disneyland are also celebrating 25years so they were offering discounts to tickets for the park. I brought my tickets from AttractionTix(which I searched on TripAdvisor to see if they are genuine and reliable ) evidently they were and very great. I got my ticket for TWO parks (Walt Studios and Disneypark) for   39 ! This also included fast track and two vouchers for    10 off for food !! It states that you must print out your parks vouchers but you don't really.To get to Disneyland Paris , we used an Uber. The taxis at the airport were charging by the metre and they reckon it usually cost about    70    90 (what a rip off). There is also a tourist info desk that offers a private bus that will cost an adult    33 and child cheaper of course. They also recommend the public bus but that takes almost 2hours to get there and was cheaper than the bus. With the Uber it takes roughly 30mins and only cost    55 which me and my mate split the fare. And I recommend people use Uber! Overall the park was great. We had beautiful weather and it wasn't really packed. Waiting times on rides were 20  30mins . Loads of food places to eat and shops to buy souvenirs of course.

38333,203553292,3,2014-4,United Kingdom,"I want this to be an objective review, rather than a negative one. We went and had a great time but it just left us feeling a bit deflated.Confession time   I'm 44 years old and a non parent so I'm not qualified to say what makes kids happy. All the kids we saw seemed to be having a great time, and that's the main thing, but I wonder how many of them knew just how much better the other 2 Disney sites are.I've been to all the Disney parks though so feel qualified to make a comparison.The Orlando park I would rate at 10 10 for the full Disney magic experience. The LA park is feeling a bit tired but still has the Disney magic, I would rate that at 7 or 8 out of 10. Disneyland Paris? 2 or 3 out of 10 for Disney magic. TIf you took away the castle in the centre,and the merchandising, you would struggle to realise it was a Disney park. We didn't see a single character walking around.The evening parade was excellent though and all the kids we saw were so excited. That bit was a really good effortI'm sure no kid has ever come away from this park disappointed, but that may not be the case if they've already been to Orlando.The Studios park is quite small and the Ratatouille, Flying Carpets, and Armageddon rides were all closed. That's a big percentage of the attractions. The  back lot  tour was OK if it's the only ride of that type you've been on but was incredibly lame compared to what's on offer in Orlando.Re the queues. In our experience the amount of time spent queuing was around 50% longer than the published times.What was most frustrating was the way the staff were loading people into the rides. Most rides were being despatched with only 75% occupancy because staff were trying to seat everybody according to their group size, leaving unoccupied seats everywhere. We queued 45 mins for the Star Tours ride and counted 6 empty seats when we finally got on the ride. We saw 4 or 5 empty seats on every train for the Armaggedon ride, even more empty seats on the train circulating the park. It's so frustrating knowing that the queue times could be significantly shorter if the staff just filled every seat.So in summary, if this is your first Disney park then you will love it. If not then it will feel lame in comparison. It's like saying that sparkling white wine is awesome, having never tried champagne. Euro Disney is the sparkling wine to Orlando's champagne ",Disneyland_Paris

31266,531633833,2,2017-10,Germany,"First let me preface my review by saying that my granddaughter was somewhat happy with her experience. However, being fortunate to have visited Disney World and Disney Tokyo, Disney Paris pales in comparison. The park in many places is run down and in need of a good paint job and wash. Several of the restrooms we used were in very poor condition   very unsanitary and dirty (I pointed this out to several employees and pushed the little  unhappy face  upon my exit). I am a retired military individual and have had to seek mother nature many times in a great variety of locations; some of the Disney restrooms were in worse condition than in some of the worlds ravaged places I have encountered. We spent four days in the two parks and at any given time 25 to 30% of the rides were having  technical problems  (these words must be taught to all Disney personnel because they are used frequently). The real frustrating part is when you are within a couple of feet getting on the ride and then to be told the ride is down because they are experiencing technical problems   this was more the rule than the exception. I will not belabor anymore of the problems we encountered, but I will say that I would have a very difficult time looking at myself in a mirror in the morning having GOUGED the public with the inflated prices for food, drink, and souvenirs.",Disneyland_Paris

We took a train there to save the traffic hassle. It was a good exposure for the kids to the rides, typical Disneyland entertainment (shows, parades, dining) including the long queues. We took advantage of the attraction tickets (time based) to avoid the queues where we could and this helped to save time.

I have taken our children and I have been there with hubby and friends and every time I come away feeling elated.Disneyland has changed over the years but the atmosphere, the characters and staff still are what make it what it is, a once in a lifetime experience (more then once if you are very lucky).It is wonderful to escape reality and visit the various 'lands', sail on the Columbia, spin in a teacup, emerge through the waterfall on the Finding Nemo submarine, travel through space on the Star Tours ride or perhaps visit the Haunted Mansion.

It was lots of fun and we had an excellent time but I think I would have been disappointed had I gone there as my only destination. The rides are pretty good but fairly dated and not nearly as diverse as the ones in Orlando. I have an eight year old who is a roller coaster fanatic but he did not find the coasters here as good as the ones at Alton Towers. The Qs were pretty long although FastPass helps but some of the rides were broken down. If you are planning a trip to Disney   save up and fly to Orlando if you can as the atmosphere, rides and customer service are all much better.

A MUST do is the TWILIGHT Tower and its elevator!!! But there are plenty pother attractions around to try out. If you can get a fast pace ticket, do it. For my 6 year old daughter to see The Magic Kingdom, she has seen in countless disney movies before the film starts, in reality, it was magic for me. Disneyworld focuses on the important people, the kids. But 2 days at Disneyworld alone are not enough! What was very disturbing to me as parent are the partly horribly long waiting lines. Some attractions, we didn't do because of waiting time of more than 2 hours and that at 11 am. We had early access from 8 am to the parc but not everything seemed open then. Service in the restaurants was generally and everywhere very slow and unattentive. I booked the 'Princess Lunch' for my little one and me. The food was very good, service not so much. I booked a wine package for an extra 20 EUR and got 2 glasses of wine 0.1l each and a glass of champagne, which I am not sure if it was as it was not poured in front of me. It tasted more like Cremant but that's only my opinion. The lunch itself was a highlight for my daughter as she met 4 princesses from 4 different disney movies and that was worth the price and I would do it again for her and with her   excluding the wine package!

33915,378664066,3,2016-5,United Kingdom,"I've been to Disneyland Orlando a couple of times and must say that this park certainly falls short by comparison. I've given it 3 stars but this is really relative to the Orlando experience and I would still recommend going if you do not want the huge expense of flying to the USA. It is still Disney, the rides and feel of the park are very similar. But the ONLY reasons I can recommend Disneyland Paris over Orlando is 1) Cost 2) Proximity and 3   You are near Paris and can mix and match your trip with a City Break.The parks feel smaller, busier and the rides and staff under more pressure than at Orlando.My biggest disappointments with Disneyland Paris are1) Ride Closures   There seems to be a permanent list of at least half a dozen rides that are closed. Most of Frontierland is currently shut for example. 2) Fast Pass   We purchased Fast Pass tickets and got to use them once. On the second day (in Disney Studios) we went to get a Fast Pass ticket for Ratatouille at around 1:30 pm and there were none available. If we wanted to go on it we would need to queue for over an hourIf you pay these prices then it is not unreasonable to expect to be able to go on the best rides in the park without spending most of your day queuing.In Orlando I don't recall queuing very much for anything and the FastPass worked brilliantly.3) Queues   Because of the ride closures there is more pressure on the other big rides. It is unreasonable to be expected to queue for an hour for a ride. On our second day nearly all the major rides had a queue of an hour4) Lack of Stage Shows 5) Lack of characters wandering aroundTIPS : 1) As soon as you enter the park get your bearings and get a Fastpass for the one ride you do not want to miss. You are only allowed one at a time so as soon as you use it go and get your next one.2) Take food and drink with you if you are not eating in a restaurant.3) Go back for the night show at 11pm. It's late but worth it. They sometimes omit the fireworks if there is rain so don't put it off for another day if you have good weather.4) Disneyland is far better than Disney Studios. Disney Studios is very small and this is where I had problems with the queues and FastPass. Try to do Disneys Studios on a day when it may be quiet.Despite my grumblings, still go. It's still fantastic but don't expect it to match up to Orlando. I have to say we had a much better day in Disneyland than Disney Studios   perhaps on another day we would have a much better experience in Disney Studios and got on the rides we wanted. Even at its best though it would still be a cut down version of Orlando. When all is said and done though I'm sure my daughter would give it 5 stars and that's what counts really.",Disneyland_Paris

The food was expensive, but approximated the American originals well enough, with nice local fare mixed in. Space Mountain was spectacular and worth many trips through the line. The riverboat jungle cruise was hysterical and available in three languages, all hilarious.My only complaint is that full size mascots and Disney Princesses were sorely missing from our experience.

6981,216012912,5,2014-7,Australia,"We spent two whole days at Hong Kong Disneyland a couple of weeks ago and it was two of the most fun filled days we have ever had. It was our first visit to a Disneyland and I had heard that the Hong Kong version was quite small compared to the others in America, Japan and France so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But we were blown away. Our first day there was pretty hot but even that couldn't dampen our spirits. Whilst there aren't a huge amount of thrill rides for older children and adults, the rides they do currently have are pretty damn good. Space mountain, Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Manor are worth the admission price on their own, and then there are other attractions like Stitch Encounter, 4d show Philharmagic, and other highly enjoyable shows like The Golden Mickeys and The Festival of the Lion King(which was brilliant).The queues were fairly long for the more popular rides, but they move pretty quickly and rarely was our wait as long as what was advertised outside the attraction and there is plenty of shade and large fans to keep people lining up cool.The food we ate at the park was very good by amusement park standards and fairly well priced, and the the park's staff were very friendly and helpful. Organisation at the park is extremely good and all the staff know exactly what they're doing so as to keep things flowing and minimise wait times as much as possible.Walking around the park(which smells like waffles in most areas) is truly a magical experience. Toy Story Land is beautiful to look at. Our daughter is almost 15 but she felt like a little kid again, as did we, especially when we watched the spectacular fireworks display that closes the park each night.Two full days was plenty of time to spend at the park but we loved every minute of our time there and can't wait to go again, particularly when they've completed the Iron Man experience.If Hong Kong is the least interesting of the Disney Parks, then we can only imagine how awesome the others must be because we had a ball.

39234,174674996,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Arrival:We arrived at about 8:15 Monday, using the Disney hours. Went straight through the entrance to the right of the park easily   no queues. Rides:(Doesn't compare with Florida at all, but for our kids aged 7 and 5 this park was a perfect size to manage). Went upstairs in the castle to see the fairy stories and the view. Then on the Carousel (5 min wait), Dumbo ride (15 min) and tea cups (10). We then did It's a small world and did it twice as there was no queue! We then went to Pirates of the C ride and queued for about 25 mins. It was about 10:15 when we came out of P of the C and you could then tell the difference in crowd numbers with it being open to everyone.Huge volumes of people, but it was a Monday and a bit rainy so I think it may have been less busy than other days! We managed to do all rides in one day and even did P of the C twice, although the queue the second time was about 45 mins (all bar Thunder and Space mountain due to our children not being tall enough) Our favourite was Buzz Lightyear   we queued about 60 mins.Kids enjoyed all of the rides no question. I found some were rushed e.g. Pinocchio, Snow White you are whirled around and it seems such a shame as you only catch a quick glimpse of the scenes which look so well made and lovely. I would rather wait in the queue a bit longer and have the ride extended for a few further minutes to make it worth it.We didn't experience any of the pushing mentioned in other queues   it all seemed orderly.The staff weren't in your face   have a nice day, happy like in Florida, but they were all pleasant enough and polite and making the effort to say how many there are of you in French and please and thank you etc goes a long way.Parade:Was at 7:00   we got there at about ten to and were about 5 rows from the front in the Main Disney Street where the parade ends. Parade was ok   short in comparison to Florida and started at about 7:20. On the second day we didn't bother with the parade, preferring to take advantage of shorter queues, and we did notice that it would have been better to have watched the parade from the Fantasyland end where it starts as there were less people, more places to stand up higher for a view, and of course if it is running late, at least you have less of a wait.Fireworks at park close:We thought the fireworks would start at about ten   but it was about 11:15! We sat on the floor slightly to the left of the castle as you look at it and had got there at about ten to ten. Most people seem to fill the main street and had been there from much earlier on. Most rides are shut so why can't they start it earlier? Disney is for kids (mostly) and by 11:15 ours (7 and 5) were asleep in our arms and looking around, we were surrounded by kids who had done the same, or those who were screaming to go back to the hotel as they were so tired and it ruined the evening for some you could tell. It's such a magical thing to watch and it was spectacular, but I wish it could be earlier in the evening as it was dark by about 9...they could open the rides again afterwards.Toilets:Important to us with two young kids   the need to make sure they have gone before you join a big queue was vital and we found lots of toilets throughout the park and they were clean.Food:We brought lots of snacks (things that wouldn't melt!) from home to avoid queues at snack bars when we could be in a queue for a ride. We also saved a huge amount of money by doing this as it is of course theme park rates for food and drink. This certainly allowed us to do more rides in a shorter space of time and keep the kids and us sane! They could nibble on snacks in queues meaning that we went from 8:15 until 5:30 with toilet stops only. We took a bottle of juice cordial in our bag and a few empty bottles and used the many water fountains outside the park or inside the park to make up squash throughout the day. Again this meant we could avoid OTT prices and fizzy drink options and meant we could keep thirst at bay throughout the day without queuing.We ate at about 5:30 on both days, the Rainforest Cafe (expensive and food only ok) and the Earl of Sandwich (good for quick service and a lot calmer than McD's) where the food was nice and we sat for about 40 mins for a break.",Disneyland_Paris

I never waited for more than a few minutes and usually ended up with a little kid or a mom whose husband had the kid in their car, or with some other third wheel from the standby lines. I also seen some people  pretending  to be single riders (they were holding hands until the employees running the ride were around, then played it  cool ) so I think you could beat the system that way if you want. I also seen a parade and all the Disney characters...and I think that Disney does a pretty good job with their princess selection...man, they all looked just like the ones in LA! I think they all could do a good job of making my dreams come true someday! haha!And since I was just at Disneyland Anaheim this year too, I can say that HK doesn't match up, but it was a fun way to spend most of my day rather than wander around and see the same old crap in Kowloon the day before I head into China...

Being a Florida native I have been to Walt Disney World countless times in my life and have seen it grow from one park to four and watched the endless resort hotels dot the landscape. They call it  World  for a reason, but that does not mean it is better, just different.Disneyland is much more compact, but the space they do have is used well. They hide the outside world very well with greenscapes, walls, fences and attractions. I forgot this park was smack in the middle of urban sprawl which is a feat in of itself. It has many similarities to WDW, but both have their cons and pros.Many of the original dark rides that Orlando disposed of are still here. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride (one of my childhood favorites), Snow White's Scary Adventures, Peter Pan's Flight (still in Orlando as well) are all accounted for. Some rides at Disneyland are bigger and better than Orlando's counterparts. Pirate's of the Caribbean and It's A Small World are bigger, longer and just plain better than Orlando's versions. There are rides that WDW does not have that I just love in Anaheim. Alice in Wonderland is my favorite Fantasyland dark ride. Really colorful and entertaining and because of very little rain in Anaheim the ride goes outside as well. The newly refurbished Finding Nemo Submarine Ride at Disneyland gave memories of Disney World's long gone 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea submarine ride. The Finding Nemo Submarine Ride is really well done and modernized and very long for a dark ride (almost 15 minutes long).Some rides or similar rides that are spread across four parks in O Town (local speak for Orlando) are crammed into the two parks in Anaheim. Disneyland has the amazing Indiana Jones Adventure (ride in the back seat for the best and roughest experience) where as Animal Kingdom has the similar ride called Dinosaur which is not near as good as the Indiana Jones ride IMO. Animal Kingdom has the better, smoother, but similar Expedition Everest roller coaster as compared to Disneyland's Matterhorn roller coaster which gave me a sore butt and an aching neck because it is so rough and old. Disneyland's Space Mountain on the other hand blows away WDW Space Mountain by being darker, smoother and the carts are bigger and more comfortable.I could go on and on, but the bottom line is this. Both Walt Disney World and Disneyland are worth visiting IMO. They both have their own unique strengths. The monorail seems pointless in Anaheim because Disneyland, California Adventure, Downtown Disney and Disney hotels are crammed together, but essential in Orlando because WDW and Epcot are so far apart and there is so much land. I will say that when you are visiting Walt Disney World you have many more and better hotel options than you do in Anaheim because WDW sits on almost 30,000 acres of land where as Disneyland sits in the middle of urban sprawl.Both parks, Disneyland and California Adventure, are fantastic parks to visit. One of the best rides in all of Disney's parks is the California Adventure Cars ride. It is similar to Epcot's Test Track, but much, much better and Cars Land is one of the coolest Disney themed areas ever created. It feels like a real mini American Southwest region.Most of all... have fun!",Disneyland_California

Our trip was a birthday present, my girl had never been to Disney Parks so we planned a trip to Paris and to the Disney park in France. The park was overall dirty, the toilets were smelly and not kept well at all. My girlfriend said the ladies toilet was disgustingly dirty. The cast members were not in their role. They were often seen just standing around and chatting amongst themselves and did not really care much to appreciate and be nice to the guest. I would rather spend my money at some other park or somewhere else in Paris. Dont get me wrong, a few of the cast members were really nice but the majority failed us. Also things there are beyond expensive. Yes in general a park is expensive but here basic things were too expensive. TIP : BRING YOUR OWN FOOD and Drinks and you will be much happier !",Disneyland_Paris

Weather was a little hot and humid for many, but a nice break from our 14 days of 95  in July! :) AND a really nice worker from California Adventure walked our way home the first evening and asked us how our day went. We explained that Goldie loves Disney AND beignets at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans. She let us in on a little surprise that right near Pirates of the Caribbean there is a little French Cafe that has MICKEY MOUSE shaped beignets!!!! What a great day!!!!! All of the Disney employees were as nice and helpful as ever!",Disneyland_California
